                        Delivering more environmentally sustainable care.
                    

A programme to reduce the carbon footprint of NHS Scotland and enable more environmentally sustainable care has been launched.
The National Green Theatres Programme, developed by clinicians, will cut the high emissions and waste typically generated in surgery while maintaining the highest levels of patient safety and quality of care.
The first set ofÂ actions will help NHS Scotland meet its net zero target by 2040 and reduce carbon emissions by 7,100 tonnes of carbon dioxide, the equivalent 4,400 single passenger returnÂ flights from Glasgow to New York.
The programme features a number of measures, all of which can be made without impacting patient safety or standards of care, including:
removing anaesthetic gases from the supply chain
moving away from single use instruments/consumables
introducing waste segregation
switching from pre-operative intravenous to oral paracetamol
The programme is being rolled out across the country following a successful pilot in NHS Highland.
Visiting the green theatre at Raigmore Hospital, Inverness, Minister for Social Care, Mental Wellbeing and Sport Maree Todd said:
â€œThe roll out of the Green Theatres Programme is a very positive step in the right direction to making our NHS net zero by 2040.
â€œOur incredible NHS staff have worked tirelessly to develop a model that not only puts patients and their safety first, but will reduce our environmental impact.â€
Dr Kenneth Barker, CfSD Clinical Lead for the National Green Theatres Programme said:
â€œOur patients always comes first but itâ€™s great that we are now making clinically safe patient care decisions with sustainability in mind.
â€œTheatres are high carbon and energy intensive areas that produce high volumes of waste, so reducing their environmental impact will make a positive difference toward achieving Scotland's net zero targets.
â€œWe are working with our National Green Theatres Specialty Delivery Group and national partners to support Boards to implement these actions and are developing a Green Map to monitor progress.â€            ",5/26/2023,Bringing down the carbon footprint in the NHS

                        Plan to grow economy, target spending and deliver progressive tax system.
                    

Economic growth, progressive taxation and spending plans that unapologetically target those in greatest need are at the heart of a financial strategy announced by Deputy First Minister Shona Robison.
The Medium-Term Financial Strategy outlines the approach to ensuring Scotlandâ€™s finances are on a sustainable footing and delivering high-quality public services in the face of high inflation. This includes:
growing the economy, including by delivering on ambitious commitments on childcare, seizing opportunities in areas where Scotland has a competitive advantage and supporting entrepreneurs, start-ups and scale-ups
taking tough decisions around spending, focusing on what is needed to achieve the missions of equality, opportunity and community
updating the tax strategy, with a new advisory group to be established this summer and chaired by the Deputy First Minister
The strategy details the tough choices required in challenging financial circumstances. Scottish Government estimates indicate that due to inflation, pay increases and the lack of further funding from the UK Government, current resource spending requirements could exceed funding by Â£1 billion in the next financial year, and by Â£1.9 billion in 2027-28. The gap between capital spending commitments and funding could rise to 16% in 2025-26.
Ms Robison said:
â€œWe are steadfast in our commitment to tackling poverty, building a fair, green and growing economy, and improving our public services to make them fit for the needs of future generations. But we must recognise that our current financial situation is among the most challenging since devolution, driven by the Covid pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the recent period of high inflation.
â€œOur funding remains largely based on decisions made by the UK Government, but they have failed to take the steps required to inflation-proof our budgets, and their decisions from Brexit to the disastrous mini-budget have made matters worse. This is creating substantial pressure on our public services, which we have no choice but to address.
â€œToday I have outlined our strategy for managing these challenges, doing all we can within our powers to ensure public finances are on a sustainable path. We will have a laser-like focus on spending, ensuring it targets equality, opportunity and community. We will generate economic growth, supporting businesses to invest and create new jobs while increasing tax revenues to invest in better public services. And we will continue to build the most progressive tax system in the UK, ensuring the burden of taxation is placed on those with the broadest shoulders.
â€œThere can be no escaping the difficult choices ahead, but by following the plan outlined today we can provide a more prosperous and fairer future for the people of Scotland.â€

                        Councils empowered to raise money for local tourism.
                    

A Bill to enable councils to invest more in local tourism facilities and services through a levy on overnight stays has been published.
If passed by the Scottish Parliament, the Visitor Levy (Scotland) Bill will give councils the power to apply a levy on stays in overnight accommodation based on a percentage of the accommodation cost.
All money raised would have to be reinvested locally on facilities and services substantially for or used by visitors, enhancing the tourist experience and benefitting local communities and their economies.
Under the plans, councils would be required to consult communities, businesses and tourism organisations before putting a visitor levy in place. They would also have to consult on how any revenue raised should be spent.
The proposals follow public consultation and form part of the New Deal for Local Government which gives councils greater financial flexibility and strengthens local democracy.
The Scottish Government has also invited representatives from the tourism industry, COSLA and other partners to join an expert group to consider how it could best be implemented if passed.
Public Finance Minister Tom Arthur said:
â€œScotland is already a very popular tourist destination and the domestic and international visitors we welcome every year have a significant and positive impact on the Scottish economy. Giving councils the power to introduce a visitor levy is one tool that will provide additional resources to continue to attract visitors to Scotland.
â€œLevies on visitors staying in paid-for accommodation are already used around the world and it is reasonable for local areas to want a small contribution from tourists to help support and sustain visitor economies.
â€œThere have been significant contributions to the Bill so far from the tourism industry, COSLA and other partners and I look forward to continuing to work with them as it progresses through Parliament.â€
COSLA Resources Spokesperson Councillor Katie Hagmann said:
â€œCOSLA welcomes the Scottish Governmentâ€™s move to give councils the power to apply a visitor levy. This represents a key step towards reaching COSLAâ€™s long-standing goal of a moreÂ empowered Scottish local government.
â€œCOSLA has consistently called for the ability of councils to set and raise taxes based on what is needed and decided locally. By providing each local authority with the power to set a rate charged to visitors, and to do so independently of the Scottish Government, the Local Visitor Levy empowers local decision-making, with councils able to respond to the needs of their area and the people who live there.
â€œCOSLA is well aware that Scotlandâ€™s councils and communities have a great diversity of needs - what works for one council will not necessarily be suitable for another.Â We welcome the flexibility offered by this legislation, and will consider if there are opportunities for it to go further. We are looking forward to seeing further investment both in tourism and our communities in the future.â€
Background
The Visitor Levy (Scotland) Bill
The Bill, if passed, will give a local authority the power to introduce a visitor levy in its area, if it wished to do so. The levy would be a percentage of the overnight accommodation cost with the rate set by the local council. Councils would be able to apply a visitor levy in all or parts of their area. The levy would be collected by the accommodation providers and remitted to the relevant local authority on a regular basis (the default being quarterly). It applies to almost all types of overnight accommodation within the area where a visitor levy is being applied, including hotels, self-catering accommodation, and campsites.
Taxes on overnight tourist stays are common across Europe and in other locations around the world. As of 2023, 21 out of the 27 EU member states charge occupancy taxes. Some cities and regions (such as Berlin) use the levy as a way to increase general revenues while others (such as Nice and the Balearic Islands) ring-fence all or part of the revenues to fund specific projects.

                        Minister responds to major report on redesigning the childrenâ€™s hearings system.
                    

Minister for Keeping the Promise Natalie Don has welcomed a landmark independent report that sets out more than 100 recommendations for transforming Scotlandâ€™s unique childrenâ€™s hearings system.
â€˜Hearings for Childrenâ€™ has been developed following a 20-month review of the childrenâ€™s hearings system, and how it can be reformed to better support children needing care and protection. The work has been led by Sheriff David Mackie, the Promise Scotland and the Hearings System Working Group (HSWG) and follows on from the publication of the Independent Care Review (The Promise), which recommended a review and redesign of the childrenâ€™s hearings system.
The Scottish Government will now take the time necessary to carefully consider the proposals contained within the report before responding later in the year.
Speaking at the launch of the report, Minister for Keeping the Promise Natalie Don said:
â€œThe Childrenâ€™s Hearings System is unique to Scotland and for over 50 years, the dedication and commitment of those working within it has been outstanding. However, the Promise is clear that the system needs to change, as childrenâ€™s experiences in the system havenâ€™t always reflected that investment of care and skill.
â€œI am very grateful to Sheriff Mackie, the Promise Scotland and the wider Hearings System Working Group for this crucial report. It has clearly been developed with care and we must apply the same levels of care and diligence when considering our response. The Scottish Government will now move forward with a programme of transformational change founded on this report. Weâ€™ll reflect on the legal, financial and workforce implications of these proposals before responding more fully later in the year. We will work closely with all partners, including those in the responsible agencies such as COSLA and Social Work Scotland to deliver wholesale positive change.
â€œWhere early positive change is possible, I am clear that should happen quickly. The changes that need new law or new structures will take time, but I want to assure children, families and those that work in the system that there will be opportunities to contribute, and to shape future reforms. Children, young people and the care-experienced community â€“ along with volunteers and professionals â€“ want to see this work yielding positive, sustainable change. I am determined that we will deliver that for them.â€
Background 
The HSWG was set up by the Promise Scotland in the summer of 2021 to Keep the Promise with regard to the redesign of the current childrenâ€™s hearings system. It is a partnership between Childrenâ€™s Hearings Scotland, Scottish Childrenâ€™s Reporters Administration and The Promise Scotland and is independent of the Scottish Government.
The Promise is the outcome of the Independent Care Review and was published in 2020. The Scottish Government signed up to all of the conclusions set out in the review and set out the actions we would take in The Promise Implementation Plan published in March 2022. Â This included a commitment to a review of the childrenâ€™s hearings system.            ",5/25/2023,Keeping the Promise

                        Beekeepers within 3km of affected hive encouraged to increase biosecurity.
                    

An outbreak of American Foulbrood (AFB) has been found in a single hive near Bridge of Earn, Perthshire.
The infected hive was detected by the beekeeper, with the disease being confirmed by SASA on 24 May 2023. This is the first finding of AFB in Scotland this year.
AFB is a notifiable disease that affects colonies of honeybees, and unfortunately there is no permitted treatment for the disease in the UK.
Beekeepers within 3km from the affected colony will be alerted via BeeBase and encouraged to increase their biosecurity.
Chief Veterinary Officer for Scotland Sheila Voas said:
â€œThe finding of AFB is a timely reminder that beekeepers should remain vigilant for signs of the disease at all times. There are no risks to public health and no implications for the quality and safety of Scottish honey.
â€œThe movement of bees and related equipment into, or out of, the affected apiary will be under specific controls supervised by Scottish Government Bee Inspectors and will include enhanced biosecurity measures and increased vigilance in the area. Â 
â€œBeekeepers should make sure they are aware of the symptoms of AFB and report suspicion of disease to the Scottish Government Bee Health Team. I would also encourage Scottish beekeepers to register on BeeBase so that they can be informed of any disease outbreaks in their area.â€
Background
AFB is a notifiable disease under The Bee Diseases and Pests Control (Scotland) Order 2007 (as amended).
Read the guidance on Honey bee health.
In 2022 there were 10 honey bee colonies confirmed positive for AFB in Scotland, in seven different apiaries and belonging to six different beekeepers.

                        Education Secretary announces summit.
                    

A summit focused on tackling violence in schools will be convened by Education Secretary Jenny Gilruth in the coming weeks.
It will bring together young people, parents and carers, schools, local authorities and unions to discuss how to tackle the problem. This will build on guidance provided to local authorities and on the Â£2 million of funding to support violence prevention activities within schools and communities.
Education Scotland will also work with every local authority to identify good practice in behaviour and relationships, sharing the findings with schools across the country.
Speaking during a debate in Parliament, Ms Gilruth said:
â€œI have been in post for two months now, and during that time I have made it absolutely clear that behaviour in schools is one of my top priorities. Children and young people must have every opportunity for successful learning that is unhindered by disruptive behaviour. I also want to make sure that teachers and school staff are working in a safe, welcoming and supportive environment.
â€œAny form of violence in our schools is completely unacceptable. No teacher or pupil should suffer verbal or physical abuse, and parents should be able to send their children to school knowing that they are safe.
â€œTo that end, Iâ€™m looking forward to bringing together young people, parents and carers, schools, local authorities, unions, and campaigners to identify how we tackle the problem of violence and disruption in our schools.â€
BACKGROUND
The Scottish Government has issued guidance for teaching staff which focuses on supporting positive behaviour and includes advice on prevention and de-escalation of incidents.
The Scottish Government is also in the process of updating national anti-bullying guidance.

                        Youth music programme funding confirmed.
                    

Culture Secretary Angus Robertson has confirmed Â£9.5 million funding for Scotlandâ€™s flagship Youth Music Initiative (YMI) this year. This includes Â£500,000 which has been ringfenced to deliver on the commitment to expand the YMI model into other art forms.
YMI funding enables schools and other organisations to provide quality music-making activities for children and young people, which range from after-school drum bands to courses in sound production.
More than 362,000 children and young people took part in YMI-funded projects under the 2021-22 programme, the majority of those in high-deprivation areas. The funding also supported 1,182 music education posts across all of Scotlandâ€™s 32 local authorities.
Mr Robertson marked the funding award with a visit to Murrayburn Primary School in Sighthill, Edinburgh, where he met pupils who have benefitted from the programme, which is administered by Creative Scotland.
The Culture Secretary said:
â€œMusic plays a vitally important role in young peopleâ€™s lives, and beyond developing their wider skills and learning we know these kinds of activities also have a huge positive impact on their confidence and wellbeing.
â€œWe are committed to ensuring every school pupil in Scotland can access a year of free music tuition by the time they leave primary school through the YMI, no matter their background. YMI is focused on creating opportunities for groups of children and young people who may not otherwise have the chance to participate in cultural activity.
â€œThis yearâ€™s funding takes our investment in this programme to more than Â£150 million since 2007, to enable free music tuition for hundreds of thousands of young people, and support thousands of music sector jobs across the country.â€
Morag Macdonald, YMI Manager said:
â€œWith ongoing support from the Scottish Government, the YMI allows local authorities to deliver programmes like this across Scotland ensuring that children and young people with additional support needs have opportunities to experience the joy and excitement that comes with making music.â€

                        Public to help shape plans for a National Care Service.
                    

People across Scotland are being invited to have a say on how a new National Care Service should work.
A programme of meetings will take place over the summer, stretching from Dumfries and Galloway to Shetland. There will also be online meetings for anyone who would prefer to join discussions remotely.
During a visit to the Allied Health Professionals in Bonnyrigg, which includes the 14 health professions that make up the third largest workforce in the NHS Scotland, Social Care Minister Maree Todd spoke with staff about what they want to see from the co-design of the new national approach.
Details for all events are now available on the online booking page. The first event will take place in Stirling on 20 June.
Ms Todd said:
â€œThere are unique demands across the country, which is why weâ€™re going to different areas, ensuring communities the length and breadth of Scotland are represented in designing a National Care Service tailored to local needs.
â€œHaving listened to care providers, unions and the third sector during the Bill scrutiny process, these meetings will allow anyone who uses care services, has a loved one that relies on care or has worked in the sector to have their say. This will help inform future stages of the Bill as it progresses through the Parliamentary process.Â 
â€œThere is general agreement that social care transformation will be of great benefit. This needs us all to have a shared understanding of what is working well and really focus on whatâ€™s needed to support people to thrive with the most suitable care for them. I would encourage everyone to be part of this conversation. To do this you can look to attend an event near you or join online, and be part of what will be the biggest social reform of our lifetimes.â€
Alison Keir, Chair of the Allied Health Professions Federation Scotland said:
â€œRehabilitation is central to improving health and social care services in Scotland. Rehabilitation services are vital to people recovering from injury or supported through illness. When people get the rehabilitative care they need, they can be discharged from hospital sooner. Then they will need less health and social care, avoid being readmitted to hospital, and be able to regain their quality of life and their role as active citizens in Scotland.
â€œAllied Health Professionals, such as occupational therapists and physiotherapists, are experts in delivering rehabilitation. It is vital we improve community provision. We will fully engage with the national care service process to ensure we have the right services and systems in place.â€

                        Increase totals 14.5% over two years.
                    

Junior doctors across Scotland have been offered a 14.5% pay uplift over the two year period 2022-24, following negotiations with BMA Scotland.
This represents a Â£61.3 million investment in junior doctor pay - the largest in the last 20 years and the best offer in the UK.
If accepted, the new and final offer will be a pay raise of 6.5% in 2023/24, as well as an additional 3% towards an already agreed 4.5% uplift in 2022/23. This amounts to a cumulative increase of 14.5% over two years and matches the recent pay award accepted by nurses and other NHS workers in 2023.Â 
This offer means a doctor at the beginning of their career would receive a total salary increase of Â£3,834 over two years. For those at the end of their training the rise would be Â£7,951 over the same period.Â 
Health Secretary Michael Matheson said:
â€œAfter weeks of intense negotiations Iâ€™m delighted our government and BMA Scotland have come to an agreement on pay which they will now put to their members.
â€œRecognising the incredible work that junior doctors do, we have offered a fair and progressive rise which will mean a pay increase of 14.5% over two years - the best offer on the table in the UK.

Rt Hon Rishi Sunak MPPrime MinisterCC: Rt Hon Therese Coffey MP
19 May 2023
Dear Rishi,
UK GOVERNMENT PUBLIC LETTER TO BRITISH FARMERS AND FUNDING ANNOUNCEMENTS
I am writing about the announcements made, including funding announcements, in your public letter to farmers earlier this week, and following your Governmentâ€™s recent Farm to Fork summit.Â 
It is pleasing to see the UK Government now recognising the growing importance of, and shifts in attitude to, overall food security in this country but it is also important to acknowledge that this follows a series of significant shocks to the food and drink sector, from COVID-19 and Brexit.Â  Those shocks have undoubtedly disrupted supply chains and created new barriers to trade.
As was confirmed by the Scottish Parliamentary debate on food security on 18th May, as much as we do to make food supply more sustainable and secure at all levels in Scotland, we do that with only a fraction of the powers, levers and funding that we need.Â I have written to UK Defra Ministers repeatedly about the range of issues impacting on the sector and to highlight to them the report of the Short-life Food Security and Supply Taskforce that the Scottish Government established together with industry about food security in March last year, in the immediate wake of the conflict in Ukraine.Â  While the Taskforce recognised that the UK Government holds many of the levers to help sort many of the issues impacting on the sector, we have not received any meaningful engagement with UK Ministers about this so far.Â  The rapid response by the Scottish Government in establishing the taskforce, and subsequently establishing a food security unit within the Scottish Government, has been important.Â  It is disappointing that the focus your Government seems to be giving to this issue now, however laudable, has not been in more evidence, sooner.Â 
In my view, it is extremely important and incumbent on us to work together constructively and in line with our Inter-Governmental relationship principles on these issues, to support the food and drink sector ably.Â  It is vital, for example, that we receive some more information about any funding announcements described in your letter this week to enable us to gauge the sufficiency, extent and implications of those announcements for the sector and to understand how these apply to Scottish agri-food producers and those of the other devolved governments.Â  A key question, for example, is whether this is new money as Scotland would clearly want to see its fair share if it is.Â  Also,Â without that further information, and while any supports are welcome, I am not convinced these announcements will go far enough to mitigate the ongoing short- and long-term significant effects on the sector, including from labour and skills shortages and high input, including energy costs. While I am disappointed that Scottish Ministers were not invited to the Summit, I am ever the optimist and hope this is the start of a process that we can build on, with the full involvement of the devolved administrations, industry and other relevant parties.
I also note the principles described in your letter about future trade negotiations.Â  ScottishÂ Ministers of course recognise that trade has an important role to play in food supply, including economically, but again, we have repeatedly made clear (and in line with Scotlandâ€™s Vision for Trade) that these trade deals must be negotiated in a way that balances market access with protection of domestic producers.Â  Scottish Ministers made those points to the UK Government repeatedly throughout the negotiation of the UK-Australia and New Zealand Trade Deals. The announcement of a set of principles now (and while on the face of it those appear to be a positive development) seem to come a little too late in the day and also provide further confirmation that those earlier trade deals were poorly negotiated by the UK Government.Â  While we will wait to see the effect of these new principles in the negotiation of future arrangements, it is imperative that UK Ministers work together with, and actively listen to, Ministers from the devolved governments and industry to ensure that our agri-food producers across the whole of the UK Â are better protected going forward. Â  Â 
As many of these issues have a significant effect on Scotlandâ€™s economy and devolved matters, I believe that it is vital that Scottish Ministers are able to discuss the detail of the announcements made this week and in your open letter to farmers, with UK Ministers and as a priority, including at our next EFRA portfolio Inter-Ministerial Group meeting.Â 
I am copying this letter to Richard Lochhead MSP, Minister for Small Business, Innovation and Trade; Vaughan Gething, Minister for the Economy; Lesley Griffiths, Minister for Rural Affairs and North Wales and Trefnydd in the Welsh Government; and to the Head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service.

                        New campaign promoting disability benefits launched
                    

Disabled people are being urged to find out if they are eligible for Scottish Government disability benefits as part of a new campaign to increase benefit take-up.Â 

The nationwide campaign aims to raise awareness about financial support available to help with the extra costs that disabled children and adults may face.

Child Disability Payment provides financial support to help families and carers with the extra costs of caring for a disabled child or young person or a child or young person with a long-term health condition. Adult Disability Payment is available toÂ  Â people aged between 16 and state pension age who are disabled, have a long-term health condition or a terminal illness.

These benefits are administered by Social Security Scotland and replace the Department for Work and Pensionsâ€™ Disability Living Allowance (DLA) for Children, DLA and Personal Independence Payment.

People already getting disability benefits from DWP will see their award transfer automatically and they do not need to apply separately.Â 

Social Justice Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said:

â€œBeing disabled or having a long-term health condition can come with a variety of extra costs, such as paying more for accessible transport. We want to make sure that disabled children and adults get all the extra financial support they are entitled to, to ease the impact of those costs.

â€œThis campaign is not just about raising awareness but also has an important role to play in helping to remove any stigma that people may be worried about when applying for social security. We believe social security is a human right. It is here for any of us should we need it and we want to make sure people are accessing what they are due.

â€œThis is the first time that we are proactively promoting disability benefits as part of a national advertising campaign, including adverts on TV. We are not aware of the UK Government running a campaign on the equivalent UK benefits for over 30-years. I want to actively encourage people to check if they are eligible for Child and Adult Disability Payments and make sure they get extra financial support to help them live full and independent lives.â€

The campaign features Piper, 9, who has Down's Syndrome. Her mum Caroline Milburn, says disability benefits have helped cover extra costs as well as give Piper opportunities sheâ€™d never have had without them.

Caroline, from Edinburgh, said: â€œPiper is such a unique character. When she was born we were told she wouldnâ€™t walk until she was around six, but she was walking at two. Sheâ€™s so determined and knows her own mind. If she wants to do something sheâ€™ll do it.

â€œDisability benefit allowed me to buy her a sensory swing and a tablet that gives her access to games that help her learn. She just thinks sheâ€™s having fun but the games have taught her so much. She plays them with her five-year-old brother sitting beside her and he learns with her.

â€œChild Disability Payment helps cover the costs of buying Piper new clothes and duvets as she is always chewing holes in themÂ  It also allows me to send her to holiday clubs. She loves them and theyâ€™re really good for her, but they cost about Â£40 a week.

â€œPiper is such an amazing girl and she makes everyoneâ€™s lives better. Without disability benefits weâ€™d not have been able to give her all the experiences and opportunities sheâ€™s had to learn and connect with the world.â€

The funding is allocated directly to practices which are in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board area and feature on the list of 100 most deprived practices in Scotland.

First Minister Humza Yousaf made the announcement as he visited the New Gorbals Health Centre in Glasgow.

The First Minister said:

â€œGeneral practice is at the heart of our communities and is uniquely placed to deliver the care and support needed by patients who experience health inequalities.

â€œOf the one hundred poorest practices in the whole of Scotland, shockingly 81 currently sit within the Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board area â€“ a statistic I am determined to change.

â€œThis additional funding of Â£1 million will build on the foundations of previous funding. At a time when the cost of living crisis is widening health inequalities, this is an important step that supports our commitments to prevention and early intervention with patients at highest risk of poor health.â€

Lorna Kelly, Chair of the Primary Care Health Inequalities Development Group said:

â€œThe NHS needs to be at its best where it is needed the most, or health inequalities will continue to worsen.

â€œThis additional resource to general practices serving the most deprived communities in Scotland is therefore very welcome.â€

Background

Inclusion Health Action in General Practice funding of Â£300,000 in 2022-23 was provided to general practices in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde with the highest levels of poverty and disadvantage.

IHAGP relates to recommendation from the Short Life Working Group on Health Inequalities in Primary Care report, published in March 2022, that the Scottish Government provide general practices with increased resources targeted at deprivation. The intent of the recommendation was:

to address a gap between existing demand-led funding allocation processes and patient needs associated with inequality; and
 to act as a bridging mechanism between the current General Practice funding formula and any future funding model/approach which takes fuller account of deprivation.

                        First Minister announces additional Â£15 million to support families.
                    

Thousands more low-income families will benefit from free school age childcare as part of a Â£15 million investment to help tackle child poverty

Existing services for eligible families in areas of Dundee, Clackmannanshire, Glasgow and Inverclyde will be expanded, with new services set up in other communities across Scotland.

Local football clubs will be able to apply for funding totalling Â£2 million to support the provision of after school and holiday activities clubs, in a joint initiative with the Scottish Football Association.

Nine other projects will also receive a share of the Â£15 million funding to continue offering childcare services in 2023-24.

First Minister Humza Yousaf made the funding announcement as he visited Ayr United Football Academyâ€™s holiday club.

The First Minister said:

""Tackling child poverty and helping families deal with cost of living pressures are key priorities.

â€œFunded school age childcare benefits families in a number of ways. It supports parents and carers into work, enabling them to provide for their families and to contribute to a wellbeing economy. It also provides safe, nurturing environments for children and opportunities for them to socialise and take part in a wide range of activities.

â€œThis Â£15 million investment is part of our work to build a system of year-round school age childcare â€“ fully funded for those who need it most.

â€œScotland already has the most generous childcare offer anywhere in the UK. All three and four-year-olds and eligible two-year-olds are entitled to 1,140 hours a year of funded Early Learning and Childcare (ELC). We are working with partners to progress our childcare offer even further, with plans to expand ELC to one-year-olds and more two-year-olds.â€

Ayr United Football Academy Chair Allan Gunning said:

""This project supports children and families by providing a wide range of activities through after school and holiday clubs.

â€œIt is delivering positive outcomes for children including: increased access to activities and sports, improved nutritional intake, enhanced fitness and engagement in wider education. The project is also delivering positive outcomes for families including; assisting with employment, education and training, increasing community involvement, and family participation in grassroots clubs and organisations.

â€œWe are delighted that project funding is continuing and appreciate the Scottish Government's ongoing commitment to improving outcomes.â€Â 

Background

Funded school age childcare is targeted at families on the lowest incomes, specifically the six priority family types identified in the Tackling Child Poverty Delivery Plan (lone parent families, minority ethnic families, families with a disabled adult or child, families with a younger mother (under 25), families with a child under one, and larger families.)

Details of the new services, including the SFA projects, will be set out in due course.

The nine projects which will receive continued funding into 2023-24 are:

Clyde Gateway, South Lanarkshire
 Hame Fae Hame, Shetland
 The Indigo Childcare Group, Glasgow
 St Mirinâ€™s Out of School Club, Glasgow
 SHIP, Perth

                        First Minister announces increased support for households with energy costs.
                    

Up to Â£30 million will be made available through the Fuel Insecurity Fund next year to help households who are at risk of self-rationing or self-disconnecting their energy use, First Minister Humza Yousaf has announced.
The funding will be made available to third sector organisations in the next financial year to support the most vulnerable households in Scotland.
The Scottish Government had previously committed to doubling the Fuel Insecurity Fund, from Â£10 million to Â£20 million.
Previous funding has been provided to third sector organisations including the Fuel Bank Foundation, Advice Direct Scotland and Scottish Federation of Housing Associations to provide direct support to households.
First Minister Humza Yousaf said:
â€œI have said my immediate priority is to do everything we can to protect every Scot as far as possible from the harm inflicted by the cost-of-living crisis.
â€œThat is why, in one of my first acts as First Minister, I can confirm today that we will build on our commitment to double the Fuel Insecurity Fund from Â£10 million to Â£20 million - to now triple it to Â£30 million for 2023-24.
â€œIn a country as energy rich as Scotland, we should not have people living in fuel poverty. My government will renew and redouble our efforts to lift people out of poverty, to make work fair, to make our economy work for the people.
â€œWith energy bills still at historically high levels and the UK Governmentâ€™s Energy Bills Support Scheme being withdrawn from 1 April, over the next year our Fuel Insecurity Fund will continue to be a vital lifeline for many struggling households in the country.
â€œIt is of course only as a result of the UK Governmentâ€™s mismanagement of the economy and the cost of living crisis that we are having to take this action. This Scottish Government will always put the interests of the people of Scotland first.â€

                        FM: new team to deliver â€˜radical, ambitious and progressive policy agendaâ€™.
                    

First Minister Humza Yousaf has unveiled his Cabinet team with five members aged under 40 and, for the first time ever, a majority of women.
In a Cabinet of ten that sees the Economy established as a portfolio in its own right:
Shona Robison, the new Deputy First Minister, will take on the Finance portfolio, including responsibility for the Scottish Budget
Michael Matheson becomes the Cabinet Secretary for NHS Recovery, Health and Social Care
Jenny Gilruth joins Cabinet for the first time as Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills
MÃ iri McAllan joins Cabinet for the first time as Cabinet Secretary for Net Zero and Just Transition
Neil Gray joins Cabinet for the first time as Cabinet Secretary for Wellbeing Economy, Fair Work and Energy
Mairi Gougeon remains Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs, Land Reform and Islands
Angus Robertson remains Cabinet Secretary for Constitution, External Affairs and Culture
Shirley-Anne Somerville becomes Cabinet Secretary for Social Justice
Angela Constance returns to Cabinet as the new Cabinet Secretary for Justice and Home Affairs
Parliament will be asked to approve the new Ministerial appointments on Thursday.
Commenting, Humza Yousaf said:
â€œThe Cabinet team I have unveiled reflects the priorities that we will pursue as a government â€“ including tackling child poverty, improving public services and building a fairer, greener economy.
â€œAhead of my appointment as First Minister, I have committed myself to a radical, ambitious and progressive policy agenda for Scotland â€“ and I know that this team is the right one to deliver it.
â€œI want to thank those Ministers departing government for their leadership over the last few years, through many storms not of our making â€“ the economic damage caused by Brexit, the COVID-19 pandemic, austerity and the cost of living crisis. Those Ministers â€“ led so ably by Nicola Sturgeon and John Swinney - leave a strong legacy for the new team to build on.
â€œI have made clear my belief Scotlandâ€™s government should look as much as possible like the people we represent. As well as being the first ever First Minister from a minority ethnic background, I am pleased that a record number of women have agreed to serve, as well as a significant blend of younger and more experienced members. That said, every single appointment has been made on merit.
â€œEvery single person in this government is clear that it is for the people of Scotland to determine their constitutional future â€“ no one else â€“ and we will work to ensure that they are given that right. As we make the case for Scottish independence, we will continue to govern well and demonstrate to the people of Scotland the benefits of decisions about their lives being taken here in Scotland.
â€œSubject to Parliamentâ€™s approval, the new Ministerial team is ready to get to work delivering for the people of Scotland.â€

Humza Yousaf has been nominated to become the sixth First Minister of Scotland, following a parliamentary vote today.

Mr Yousaf also announced his intention to appoint Shona Robison as Deputy First Minister.

MSPs voted 71 to 57 to select Mr Yousaf as First Minister from a total of four nominees who put themselves forward; he will be formally appointed this afternoon with a Royal Warrant from His Majesty King Charles III.

He will be sworn in at the Court of Session on Wednesday, where he will take the Official Oath in front of the Lord President of the Court of Session and other senior judges.

First Minister-designate Humza Yousaf said:

â€œThis is a really proud day for me and my family. I hope it is also a proud day for Scotland, as it speaks to our values as a country as I stand here as the first ever Muslim to lead a western democratic nation.

â€œA key priority of my government will be to protect every Scot, as far as we can, from the harm that has been inflicted by the cost-of-living crisis. We will protect and we will reform our NHS and social care and other vital public services â€“ to support our wellbeing economy to improve the life chances of people right across our country. We will rapidly develop plans to extend childcare, improve rural housing, support small businesses, and boost innovation.

â€œOn Thursday, I will nominate the team of Ministers who will deliver on those priorities. I will then set out more detailed policies to this chamber in the first week after the Easter recess.

â€œI am also pleased to confirm my intention to appoint Shona Robison as Deputy First Minister â€“ her counsel and cross-government experience has been indispensable to me so far, and I look forward to working together as we deliver for the people of Scotland.

â€œThe Parliament has given me the opportunity to help steer this nationâ€™s course, as we make the next stage of that journey together. Doing that will be the honour and the privilege of my life. I will strive every single minute of every day to be worthy of it and will do so in the best interests of our nation.â€

Deputy First Minister-designate Shona Robison said

â€œI am honoured to accept Humzaâ€™s request to be his Deputy First Minister. I look forward to working with him and our Cabinet on the issues that matter most to the people of Scotland.

â€œI have served alongside Humza for a long time and I know that his leadership will build on the solid foundations we have been left by the former First Minister and Deputy First Minister.

                        Â£250,000 boost to gift card initiative.
                    

A scheme aimed at boosting trade in town and city centres is going digital.
Scotland Loves Local (SLL) gift cards can be loaded with credit and used in participating shops and businesses within usersâ€™ local council area.
Now the Scottish Government is investing Â£250,000 to enable the cards to operate digitally via devices such as mobile phones.
By going digital, the cards can be used by businesses to reward loyal customers and encourage repeat custom. The new system may also be made compatible with transport providersâ€™ ticketing systems, allowing relatives or businesses to gift train and bus fares into town centres for shopping trips.
Cards are currently utilised by more than 20 councils â€“ including six which have used them to distribute more than Â£13 million of Scottish Government Coronavirus (Covid-19) economic recovery funding to lower income households.
Visiting Barrhead, where the SLL cards have helped boost business in the town centre, Community Wealth Minister Tom Arthur said:
â€œGoing digital is an important step forward for the SLL gift card. The scheme has already delivered millions of pounds of extra spending to help businesses recover from the pandemic and by increasing their useability I am sure even more people will be encouraged to shop locally.
â€œThe cards have made a real difference in places like Glasgow, where thousands of cards have been used to access Scottish Government funding for economic recovery.
â€œThey represent a step towards the creation of local currencies to be invested and retained within areas. Digitalisation will accelerate that process and help support fairer and more prosperous local economies.â€
Scotlandâ€™s Towns Partnership (STP) delivers the SLL initiative â€“ which includes the gift card - encouraging people to support their communities by spending locally. Interim Chief Officer Kimberley Guthrie said:
â€œThe Scotland Loves Local campaign is a force for good - galvanising communities to support local people and businesses at times when they have never needed that more.
â€œThe need for us all to think, choose and spend locally is critical, not only in our ongoing recovery from the impact of Covid-19 on businesses, but in helping us all through the cost of living crisis and in responding to the climate emergency.
â€œContinued support from the Scottish Government allows businesses and communities to innovate, invest and embrace opportunity, building better, stronger places.â€
Background
In August 2021 the Scottish Government launched the SLL programme to help Scotlandâ€™s towns and neighbourhoods recover from the pandemic through support for local economies. So far 6,659 businesses have registered to accept gift cards. Of those, 75% are independent or franchised businesses. On top of those issued by local authorities, almost 5,000 SLL gift cards were purchased during 2022/23.

                        Support package of up to Â£14 million announced.
                    

Seafood businesses and marine organisations in Scotlandâ€™s coastal communities are set to benefit from a new year of funding through Marine Fund Scotland.
A total of up to Â£14 million of funding will be available in 2023/24 to encourage the sustainable use of marine resources for economic growth, support livelihoods and jobs whilst preserving the health of marine and coastal ecosystem.
In the past, projects benefitting from the fund included modernisation of a salmon and trout processing facility in order to reduce energy and water use, installation of solar panels at a seafood cold store to cut back on its carbon footprint, and process capacity building for a shellfish producer to meet the growing demand from premium markets in the US and Asia.
Rural Affairs Secretary Mairi Gougeon said:
â€œMarine Fund Scotland has been crucial in supporting marine businesses and projects over the past two years. I look forward to many more exciting and innovative initiatives benefiting from it over this coming year.
â€œOur seas and coasts support vital jobs across our economy, especially in coastal and island communities. The last few years have been incredibly challenging for the sector with Brexit, the COVID-19 pandemic and the cost-of-living crisis all having an impact.
â€œThis fund continues to be key in supporting the sustainable development of Scotlandâ€™s blue economy and will play an important role in enabling our marine and fisheries businesses to grow.â€
Donna Fordyce Chief Executive of Seafood Scotland said:
â€œThe Marine Fund Scotland has been crucial in the promotion of Scottish Seafood in both developing new markets for the premium seafood we produce, but also in retaining existing markets.Â 
â€œThis is particularly so given the impacts of the last few years with Brexit and the Covid pandemic.Â  We are now also in the midst of a costs of living crisis, which requires continuing effort to ensure that the quality and affordability of Scottish seafood is recognised.â€ Â Â 
Background
Applications for funding can be submitted via a new web portal which will be live from 10 am on from 11 April 2023.Â  The application and scheme guidance will be updated ahead of that date for the 2023-24 scheme.
Marine Fund Scotland was established following the UKâ€™s exit from the EU and replaces funding for the fishing and seafood sector previously available through the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF).

Children will have access to high quality play areas, which will remain free of charge, as a result of new investment.
The Scottish Government and COSLA have agreed Â£50 million in funding to local authorities over the next three years for the refurbishment of childrenâ€™s play parks.
Play parks identified for refurbishment by local authorities are expected to be revamped thanks to the additional funding.
Childrenâ€™s Minister Clare Haughey visited Figgate Park in Edinburgh with pupils from Duddingston Primary School on Thursday.
Ms Haughey said:
â€œPlaying outdoors has huge benefits for childrenâ€™s physical and mental wellbeing, and play parks ensure children can access high quality safe environments free of charge as families grapple with the cost of living crisis.
â€œThis funding will support local communities to take forward their plans to improve play parks for children in their area.â€
BACKGROUND
As set out in the 2021 Programme for Government, the Scottish Government will invest Â£60 million over the course of this Parliament to renew public, free-to-access play parks.
The Scottish Government provided Â£5 million towards this commitment in 2021 followed by a further Â£5 million available to local authorities in 2022.
The additional Â£50 million of funds will be allocated over three years on the following basis:
2023-24 - Â£10 million
2024-25 - Â£15 million

                        New Fund to help grow local supply chains.
                    

Small scale producers are set to have access to a range of new support designed to create more localised supply chains and cut food miles.
The Scottish Governmentâ€™s Small Producers Pilot Fund aims to help individual small producers increase their resilience and enhance their contribution to the rural economy.
Planned to open later this year, the Pilot Fund will improve access to training, skills, further processing, and food supply chains â€“ helping producers enhance their value and become more sustainable.
In partnership with the Scottish Agricultural Organisation Society (SAOS) and agriculture, small holding and food industry stakeholders, the government has set up an industry-led steering group to co-design the Pilot Fund and their first meeting is on the 28th March 2023.
Rural Affairs Secretary Mairi Gougeon announced the pilot fund steering group at the Rare Breeds Survival Trustâ€™s 50th anniversary conference in Fife. Ms Gougeon said:
â€œWe are committed to ensuring accessible support for small producers and small businesses, including small scale food production and processing.
â€œWorking in partnership with the Scottish Agricultural Organisation Society (SAOS), agricultural, small holding and food industry stakeholders, the Steering Group will design a flexible funding approach that supports local food supply chains, improves access to the right training opportunities, and helps link together small producers into existing abattoirs.
â€œThe Small Producers Pilot Fund will replace the Small Farms Grants Scheme, and aims to increase the proportion of food grown and processed by small farms and small holders, and consumed locally by their local community, including those affected by the cost of living crisis.â€
SAOS Business Development Manager Helen Glass commented:
â€œThe pilot will assist in creating more-localised food supply chains, enhancing producer value and cutting food miles. Additionally,Â it will provide the opportunity to support individual small producers in developing their skills and will be key to supporting these producers in enhancing the vital contribution they already make to the rural economy.â€
Vice President Scotland, Rare Breeds Survival Trust Martin Beard said:
â€œSmall scale producers farming with our hardy, low input native breeds are crucial to a future for Scottish farming where high quality, high welfare food production goes hand in hand with environmental sustainability.
â€œThis initiative from Government, combined with action on challenges such as the scarcity of local abattoirs, can help unlock the potential of small scale producers for Scotlandâ€™s communities, economy and environment.â€            ",3/23/2023,Supporting Scotlandâ€™s small producers

The latest poverty statistics, covering the period to March 2022, show little recent change in poverty levels for children, working-age adults and pensioners.
Two out of the four child poverty measures in the Child Poverty (Scotland) Act (relative and absolute poverty) are broadly stable. Persistent poverty is gradually increasing, and the material deprivation measure continues to be affected by the pandemic.
While the poverty risk is much lower for children where someone in the household is in paid work compared to those in workless households, not all work pays enough to lift the household above the poverty line. Over two thirds of children in poverty live in a household with someone in paid work.
Working-age adults and pensioners are less likely to be in poverty compared to children: 15% of pensioners and 21% of working-adults are in relative poverty after housing costs, compared to 24% of children. Poverty levels have been broadly stable for all age groups.
Adults under 25 are more likely to be in poverty than older adults. Minority ethnic households are more likely to be in poverty compared to white British households. Muslim adults are more likely to be in poverty compared to adults of Christian and other faiths and those with no religion. Some, but not all, of the higher poverty risk for minority ethnic groups and Muslims can be explained by their lower average age. Single adults, especially single parents, and those who are divorced or separated are more likely to be in poverty compared to married, cohabiting and widowed adults. People living in households with disabled household members are also more likely to be in poverty than those with no disabled household members.
Background
The two full statistical publications are available here:
Poverty and Income Inequality in Scotland contains statistics on poverty, child poverty, poverty risks for various equality characteristics, household income and income inequality for Scotland. This report also includes new statistics on household food security. The data comes from the Department for Work and Pensionsâ€™ (DWP) Family Resources Survey, Households Below Average Income dataset. Comparable UK income and poverty figures are published on the same day by DWP.
Figures are presented as three-year averages of each estimate. Three-year estimates best identify trends over time. Single-year estimates are also available in the reference tables. The latest poverty and household income data in this report covers the period from April 2019 to March 2022.
The COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact on data collection and sample sizes. This resulted in more volatile estimates in the most recent period. In addition, data collected during the year between April 2020 and March 2021 was excluded from the most recent estimates as the data was not robust.
Persistent Poverty in Scotland presents estimates of the proportion of people in Scotland who live in persistent poverty. The data comes from the Understanding Society Survey, and the latest statistics cover the period from 2017 to 2021.
These poverty statistics are used by the Scottish Government and other organisations to monitor progress in tackling poverty and child poverty, and to analyse what drives poverty and what works for tackling poverty and income inequality.
Official statistics are produced in accordance withÂ the Code of Practice for Statistics.
Key poverty measures:
Relative poverty: A household is in relative poverty if its income is below 60 percent of the middle household income in the UK (the poverty threshold). Relative poverty is a measure of whether the income of the poorest households are keeping pace with middle income households across the UK
Absolute poverty: A household is in absolute poverty if its income is below the relative poverty threshold from 2010/11. This way, it measures whether the incomes of the poorest households are keeping pace with rising prices
Combined low income and material deprivation identifies the number of children in families that cannot afford basic essential goods and services because of a low income (below 70 percent of the middle household income)
Persistent poverty identifies the number of people in relative poverty for three or more out of four years. People who live in poverty for several years are affected by it through their lifetime
Household income is adjusted for household size.
The poverty publications present poverty figures before and after housing costs. Before housing costs figures are a basic measure of household income from earnings and benefits. After housing costs figures subtract spending on rents, mortgage interest payments and other unavoidable housing costs from this basic income. In Scotland, poverty statistics focus mainly on poverty after housing costs. The poverty estimates in this summary refer to relative poverty after housing costs.
Further information on income and poverty statistics within Scotland is available.            ",3/23/2023,Poverty levels broadly stable

                        Proposals â€˜balance fairness with affordability and fiscal sustainabilityâ€™.
                    

The framework for public sector pay increases in 2023-24 has been published, recognising the volatility of economic conditions while balancing the need for sustainable public services.
The new Public Sector Pay Strategy recommends public sector workers receive an increaseÂ of 3.5%, in line with the UK Governmentâ€™s recommended pay rise for the public sector.
It sets a maximum pay uplift of 5% where there are justifying circumstances, suggests a Â£1,500 cash uplift for workers who earn Â£25,000 or less and commits to a review of Chief Executivesâ€™ pay.
Public bodies will be required to pay the real Living Wage at Â£10.90 per hour, including for internships and Modern Apprentices.
The strategy also maintains the Scottish Governmentâ€™s commitment to no compulsory redundancies in the public sector as well as the delivery of a public sector pilot for a four-day working week.
It also strongly encourages employers to standardise to a 35-hour working week and puts in place provisions for the â€˜right to disconnectâ€™, which would support people to switch off from work and enjoy their free time without being disturbed by emails, messages or calls during non-work hours.
Deputy First Minister John Swinney said:
â€œThis pay strategy focuses on making sure we balance fairness with affordability and sustainability of public finances while recognising the vital contribution of public sector workers in Scotland.
â€œThe Scottish Government sees fair public sector pay deals and a policy of no compulsory redundancies as a response to the cost of living crisis and the strategy continues to promote our progressive approach to pay by including cash uplifts for those on low incomes.
â€œAt the same time, it recognises that organisations across the public sector, including the Scottish Government, are subject to constrained funding and acknowledges the recurring impact of pay deals. This may mean public bodies need to take decisions on the size and shape of their workforce to ensure affordability in the medium-term. We expect this to be achieved through natural turnover and effective workforce planning.
â€œThe Chancellorâ€™s Spring Budget was silent on public sector pay, despite our calls for additional funding across the UK to support fair pay awards.
â€œThe limited additional funding for the Scottish Government did not go far enough so toÂ fund public sector pay increases, we will have to find money from within our budget to invest in public services and provide fair, affordable and sustainable pay rises.â€
Background
The 2023-24 Public Sector Pay Strategy
The pay strategy applies to around 52,000 staff in the Scottish Government and its associated agencies and non-departmental public bodies, such as Scottish Enterprise and NatureScot. It also covers NHS senior management posts and all public appointments, including the Chairs of public bodies.
A full list of public bodies the strategy covers is available on the Scottish Governmentâ€™s website.
The strategy also acts as a reference point for other parts of the public sector workforce including NHS Scotland, fire-fighters and police officers, teachers and further education workers. For local government employees, pay and other employment matters are delegated to local authorities.            ",3/22/2023,Public sector pay strategy published

A fund that helps to tackle inequality and discrimination has supported more than 115,000 people in its first year.
The Scottish Governmentâ€™s Equality and Human Rights Fund is providing Â£21 million in grants over three years to 48 organisations working with diverse communities to further equality and protect human rights.
Funded initiatives include advice helplines, mental wellbeing sessions, English classes and benefits advice.
Equalities Minister Christina McKelvie visited the West of Scotland Regional Equality Council (WSREC) in Glasgow, to see how people have benefited from their work.
Ms McKelvie said:
â€œWe want to build a fairer, more equal Scotland which is free from discrimination and where the human rights of everyone are respected, protected and fulfilled.
â€œI was very pleased to visit WSREC and see the range of activities that they deliver. For example, their cost of living advice service for people from minority ethnic communities has helped to boost family incomes and lift children out of poverty.
â€œWSREC is just one of 48 organisations that receive grants from the Equality and Human Rights Fund. From advocacy support to public education, these organisations are transforming the lives of the thousands of people that they work with.â€
Ghzala Khan, Executive Director at WSREC, said:
â€œBased in Glasgow, the West of Scotland Regional Equality Council supports a range of minority ethnic communities across 12 local authorities.
""The Equality and Human Rights Fund has enabled us to deliver bi-lingual, culturally sensitive services to marginalised minority ethnic groups in the areas of advice and information, employability, direct discrimination, civic participation and health and wellbeing.
â€œOur work reduces inequality, increases opportunity, and supports people and families to achieve their full potential.""

                        DFM says Spring Budget falls short on vital lifelines.
                    

Deputy First Minister John Swinney has described the UK Governmentâ€™s Spring Budget statement as â€œanother missed opportunityâ€ to help households, businesses and public services through the cost of living crisis.
He said Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt had failed to deploy the full range of powers available to him to mitigate the impact of soaring energy prices and high inflation.
While welcoming a number of individual measures such as the extension of the energy price guarantee â€“ and with a typical householdâ€™s monthly energy bills set to rise by almost half from March to April â€“ Mr Swinney said substantive actions such as restoring the Universal Credit uplift were notably absent.
He also called for the UK Government to inflation-proof the Scottish Governmentâ€™s budget so it can better co-ordinate spending across Scotland.
Mr Swinney said:
â€œThis UK Budget is another missed opportunity to take meaningful action to lift families out of poverty, invest in our public services and help businesses so that our economy can grow.
â€œInstead, the UK Government should have taken more substantive action to increase the Scottish Governmentâ€™s budget so we can better align spending and deliver for people and organisations right across Scotland.
â€œWhile reversal of the planned increase in the energy price guarantee is welcome, with the end of the energy bills support payments, typical household monthly bills will still rise by more thanÂ half from March to April, at a time when wholesale energy costs are falling.
â€œRising interest rates combined with reduced support means some people are expected to experience a larger fall in living standards this coming year than they have over the last 12 months.
â€œAn uplift on Universal Credit and extending this to legacy benefits would have made a meaningful difference to households struggling to make ends meet.
â€œThe limited additional money for the Scottish Governmentâ€™s Budget is welcome but will not go far enough and in the long-term our capital funding will fall in real-terms. Without extra funding, we will have to find money from within the Scottish Budget to invest in public services, provide fair pay rises and help people with the cost of living.
â€œThe Scottish Government is doing what it can with its limited powers to ensure people receive the help they need, but the UK Governmentâ€™s could have done far more to ease the burden affecting so many, demonstrating yet again why Scotland needs the powers of independence.â€
Background
In a letter to the Chancellor ahead of the Spring Budget, the Deputy First Minister had urged specific measures to help households, invest in public services and support the economy to grow - including reinstating the uplift to Universal Credit and providing tax incentives for businesses.
Ahead of the UK Budget, the Resolution Foundation estimated that typical incomes among non-pensioner households will fall by 4% in 2023-24 in real terms, compared to 3% in 2022-23.            ",3/15/2023,A â€˜missed opportunityâ€™ for meaningful action

The UK Government is being urged to invest in public services and deploy its full range of powers to tackle the cost of living crisis, supporting people and businesses.
Deputy First Minister John Swinney has written to the Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt ahead of his Spring Budget to call for targeted support to help more families out of poverty by reinstating the uplift to Universal Credit, increasing it to Â£25 per week and extending it to means-tested legacy benefits.
He said vulnerable households should not have to bear the burden of soaring energy prices, and called for windfall tax revenues to fund much-needed support. Mr Swinney also pressed for support for struggling businesses to provide the certainty to invest and grow.

                        Uplift in bursaries and loan packages.
                    

Financial support available to undergraduate students will rise by Â£900 from the start of the 2023-24 academic year.
Estranged students in higher education and other undergraduate learners with the lowest household income will see their maximum support package increase from Â£8,100 to Â£9,000 per year, as the ceiling for all student loan applications is uplifted by Â£900.
The annual non-repayable Care Experienced Bursary for eligible higher education students will also increase to Â£9,000. In further education, a Â£900 increase will also be applied to the maximum bursary rate available to care experienced students.
These increases will be available to students already at college and university and for new students beginning their studies from Autumn 2023.
Students in need of immediate financial support for the 2022-23 academic year are still able to apply to their college or university for assistance through their Discretionary Funds.
Higher and Further Education Minister Jamie Hepburn said:
â€œThis rise in support will help to alleviate the financial pressures facing many students as we grapple with the cost-of-living crisis.
â€œThe maximum financial support package available to the most vulnerable students and those from the lowest household incomes in Higher Education will rise to Â£9,000. This is the next step in delivering our commitment to provide a total package of student support equivalent to the living wage.
â€œIncreasing the Care Experienced Bursary will help more of Scotlandâ€™s Care Experience community to access further and higher education and fulfil their potential.â€
Who Cares? Scotland CEO Louise Hunter said:
""Itâ€™s great to hear news of the Â£900 increase in financial support available to students in Scotland. Iâ€™m sure this will be welcomed by many students who are struggling to balance their education and finances during the cost-of-living crisis. Raising the Care Experienced Student Bursary to Â£9,000 per year responds to the specific challenges this group can face.Â For many Care Experienced people without family to rely on for support during their studies, they can face greater barriers in realising their lifelong right to education.
â€œWe know that Care Experienced people are often disproportionality disadvantaged compared to their peers and in recognition of this Who Cares? Scotland will continue to fight for the rights of Care Experienced Students - as committed to within The Promise.Â This means we can ensure all members of our community are given the right support to thrive.â€
BACKGROUND
The uplift will be applicable to higher education students receiving SAAS funding, including Scottish domiciled students studying elsewhere in the UK. The rise in financial support for further education students will only apply to those studying in Scotland.
The 2021 Programme for Government committed an ambitious reform to student financial support, including to expand our total student support package to reach the equivalent of the living wage.
The Scottish Funding Council will announce other bursary maintenance rates for further education students in due course.
Further details for support rates available to students in 2023-24 academic year will be available on the SAAS website from March 2023.            ",3/14/2023,Increased support for students

                        Improving homes in remote and rural communities.
                    

Crofters across Scotland will be able to apply for larger sums of money to upgrade their housing under the Croft House Grant.
To help ensure more crofters and their families can benefit, the government is increasing the grant rate for home improvements from 40% to 60% of the total project cost â€“ with a maximum grant of Â£38,000.
The grant scheme also supports crofters to build new homes, allowing them to maximise the full potential of their crofts and to retain and attract people to remote and rural communities.
Last year the Scottish Government awarded more than Â£850,000 in Croft House Grant funding to support 28 crofters and their families.
Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and Islands Mairi Gougeon said:
â€œCrofters are so important to our rural and island communities. They play an integral role contributing to the long-term sustainability of these often fragile areas.
â€œThe Croft House Grant enables crofters to enjoy the full potential of their crofts while generating economic success - and I have seen first-hand the difference it can make.
â€œWe must do all we can to attract and retain people in our crofting communities, particularly young families. Thatâ€™s why we are committed to continuing and improving this vital support.â€
Chief executive of the Scottish Crofting Federation Patrick Krause said:
â€œHousing and fuel poverty are major issues we face in rural Scotland, and, despite the soaring costs, we need more homes, homes that that are ecologically sound. So this is very welcome news.
""It is hearting to see Scottish Government adding to a very effective scheme that has helped hundreds of families to get established, and particularly in helping with improvements to existing buildings, upgrading to be more environmentally efficient, extending and bringing older buildings back into use. It is a win for all.â€
Background
Find out more about the Croft House Grant scheme and how to apply on the Scottish Government's Rural Payments and Services website:Â Croft House Grant (ruralpayments.org)
Crofting tenure requires crofters to live within 32 kilometres of their croft and provide their own housing, so the Croft House Grant can assist crofters to meet their statutory duty.Â  There are four application rounds every year, March, June, September and December, and eligible applications are assessed using a scoring system, which is designed to target support at those who would not be able to build or improve their home without grant support.
Since the scheme was launched in 2007 more than Â£24.2 million has been awarded to over 1,100 families and individuals living and working in rural and island communities.Â             ",3/14/2023,More support for Scotlandâ€™s crofters

                        Emergency protections for tenants extended.
                    

Private rent increases will be capped at 3% and restrictions will remain on enforcement of evictions under measures approved today by MSPs.
The changes to the Cost of Living (Tenant Protection) Act will mean that from 1 April 2023:
If a private landlord chooses to increase a tenantâ€™s rent mid-tenancy, the increase will be capped at 3%
Private landlords will alternatively be able to apply for a rent increase of up to 6% to help cover certain increases in costs in defined and limited circumstances
Enforcement of evictions will continue to be paused for up to six months except in a number of specified circumstances
Increased damages for unlawful evictions of up to 36 monthsâ€™ worth of rent will continue to apply
These measures will be extended to 30 September, provided they remain necessary, with the option to extend for another six-month period if required.
As previously announced, the social sector rent freeze has been replaced with agreements from landlords to keep any rent increase for 2023-24 well below inflation. The rent cap for student accommodation is to be suspended, recognising its limited impact on annual rents set on the basis of an academic year.
Tenants' Rights Minister Patrick Harvie said:
â€œOur emergency legislation has given tenants across the rented sector additional protection as we continue to live through these challenging and uncertain economic times.
â€œIt is clear that many households in the private rented sector in particular continue to struggle, which is why we are capping in-tenancy rent increases in the private sector at 3% from next month, with safeguards in place recognising the effects the cost of living crisis may have on some landlords. Our restrictions on evictions will continue across all sectors, with the social sector rent cap having been replaced with voluntary agreements from landlords to keep rents affordable.
â€œWe will continue to keep these measures under review, ensuring they remain necessary and proportionate to the challenges at hand.â€
BackgroundÂ 
The evictions moratorium pauses enforcement of eviction actions resulting from the cost of living crisis except in a number of specified circumstances. Evictions can be delayed for a maximum of 6 months while the measures are in force.
Landlords can apply to Rent Service Scotland (RSS) to increase rent to partially cover specific costs including increased mortgage interest payments on the property they are letting, an increase in landlordsâ€™ insurance or increases in service charges paid as part of a tenancy, subject to an overall limit. This limit is currently set at 3% of total rent. From 1 April the limit will be increased to 6%.Â In effect this retains the ability for landlords to raise rents at a level of 3% above the cap.
Under theÂ agreement on social rents for 2023-24, COSLA has committed to keeping local authority rent increases to an average of no more than Â£5 a week. Members of the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations and Glasgow West of Scotland Forum of Housing Associations have reported planned increases averaging 6.1%.

                        John Swinney thanked for â€œsupport, wisdom and friendshipâ€.
                    

Deputy First Minister John Swinney has announced he is leaving the Scottish Government after nearly 16 years. Â 
He will stand down as Deputy First Minister once a new First Minister is appointed later this month and return to the backbenches. He is the longest serving Deputy First Minister on record, having held the post for almost nine years, and also served as Education Secretary and two tenures as Finance Secretary, latterly in an interim role.
In a letter to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Mr Swinney says it has been an â€œhonour to serve Scotlandâ€ and that he has always sought â€œto transform the life chances of everyone.â€
In her reply, the First Minister pays tribute to Mr Swinneyâ€™s â€œdeep care and attention to the wellbeing of our nationâ€ and says she could not have wished for a better â€œpartner in governmentâ€.
Background
Mr Swinneyâ€™s letter to the First Minister
It has been the privilege of my life to serve in the Scottish Government since 2007 as a Cabinet Secretary with responsibility first for Finance and the Economy, then Education and Skills and finally Covid Recovery. It has been my honour to serve Scotland as your Deputy First Minister since 2014.
These have been demanding commitments to fulfil over nearly 16 years and I have decided that, when the First Minister is appointed later in March, I will stand down from government.
When I joined the Scottish National Party at the age of 15 in 1979, our political prospects were poor and I could scarcely have imagined that over so many years I would have the opportunity to serve Scotland in government in the way I have.
In all that I have undertaken in government, I have tried to listen carefully to different views and be open to the ideas and thoughts of people in Scotland. I have sought always to transform the life chances of everyone who lives here. I have acted to make Scotland a fairer, more prosperous and more confident country that I believe would be assured with Independence.
In all of that work, I have deeply valued the advice and professionalism offered to me by so many outstanding civil servants with whom I have had the privilege to work. They are a credit to their service. I have been touched constantly by the kindness of people in Scotland and their understanding of the many challenges with which we have to wrestle in Government. I am grateful to my ministerial and parliamentary colleagues for their collaboration and support. And I am indebted to you for your leadership, constancy, friendship and loyalty.
I will continue to faithfully represent my constituents in Perthshire North and look forward to sitting with you on the back benches of the Scottish Parliament to continue our contribution to Scotlandâ€™s cause.
Thank you for the opportunity you have given me to serve my country.
The First Ministerâ€™s reply
Thank you for your letter.
Your contribution to our nation, almost 16 years in government is considerable, indeed unique. Therefore, while I - perhaps more than most - completely understand your decision, I still felt a real sense of sadness when you told me of it.
As Finance and Economy Secretary in our newly formed Scottish Government in 2007, you steered us successfully through budget after budget, laying the foundations for a long list of policy successes.
You were also the architect of a new partnership with local government, and helped negotiate a a new financial settlement with the UK Government, the Fiscal Framework, rebuffing in the process attempts to strip Scotland of funding.
As Education Secretary, you piloted reforms that are now delivering progress in our mission to close the attainment gap. You presided over an increase in teacher numbers and opened university education to record numbers of young people from the poorest backgrounds.
Perhaps most significantly for the long-term, you delivered the biggest expansion in early learning and childcare in our countryâ€™s history - a transformation that will change the lives of future generations of children for the better. I know you are as proud of this policy as I am - and rightly so.
Your role in Scotlandâ€™s recovery from Covid also merits special mention. From the darkest days of the first lockdown, you led our work on the â€˜four-harmsâ€™ approach that guided exit from public health restrictions. From a more personal perspective, your friendship and wise counsel during the pandemic, which was by far the most challenging period of my tenure as First Minister, was invaluable and helped me through some really tough days.
You returned for a second, interim tenure as Finance Secretary just as UK Government mismanagement was causing calamity in the nationâ€™s finances and economy. However, in the face of spiraling inflation, you focussed firmly on protecting the most vulnerable, tackling child poverty, addressing climate change and building sustainable public services. Bringing to bear all your experience of government â€“ and the deep care and attention to the wellbeing of our nation that I know you feel â€“ you helped protect thousands from the full impact of the cost of living crisis. Securing funding for the expansion of the game-changing Scottish Child Payment was the most important of many initiatives.
There is so much more that I could highlight. Over almost 16 years in government, more than eight years as Deputy First Minister â€“ indeed, the longest serving Deputy First Minister so far â€“ you have made countless contributions to the good of our people and our country.
In short, I could not have wished for a better partner in government than you, and there is no doubt that our Scottish Government would have achieved much less had you not been in it.
Please accept my thanks for your support, wisdom and, above all, friendship as together with Ministers past and present, we sought to make Scotland a better place. As I said when I announced my own departure from office, serving as First Minister has been the privilege of my life - having done so with you by my side as Deputy First Minister has been an honour.
As for the future, I know you will continue to serve Scotland well and that you will be, as you always have been, a source of good advice and wise counsel to our party, government and movement. I look forward to this new phase - for both of us - as we move to the backbenches and make way for the new generation who will now lead Scotland forward.
With grateful thanks and friendship always.

                        Â£155 million in payments since introduction in February 2021
                    

There were 184,000 children and young people getting Â£25 per week in Scottish Child Payment by the end of 2022, latest statistics show.Â 
The figure includes 78,000 who have received it since the payment was extended to include children aged between six and 16 in November.Â 
Social Security Scotland had provided decisions to just over half the people who applied on the extension of the payment by the end of 2022.
Decisions for the majority of people who applied or added additional children to their award between 14 November and 31 December 2022 have now been issued and this will be reported on in the next round of statistics.
Scottish Child Payment was announced in the summer of 2019, with the first payments being made in February 2021.
Since then it has risen from Â£10 per week per child to Â£25 per week per child - a 150% increase in value.
It means that the amount paid out to children totals Â£155 million until the end of last year.
Ahead of extending Scottish Child Payment to under-16s, local authorities also made more than 1.1 million Bridging Payments across 2021 and 2022 to the families of school age children worth a total ofÂ Â£169.3 million.
Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison said:
â€œâ€œThese figures demonstrate our commitment to tackling child poverty and the significant financial support we have made available to meet that aim.
â€œThis is just a snapshot of all the work being done since Scottish Child Payment was extended and increased until the end of 2022.
""Weâ€™ve since processed tens of thousands more applications.
â€œThis represents remarkable progress in the delivery of the most ambitious child poverty reduction measure in the UK.
â€œThat increased payment of Â£1,300 per child per year is now benefitting families across Scotland.
â€œWe want to make sure that everyone gets the help available to them. Parents or carers who are on universal credit, tax credits or other benefits and who have children under 16 should check through Social Security Scotland if they are eligible.â€
Background
Scottish Child Payment is part of a wider package of five family payments including: Best Start Grant Pregnancy and Baby Payment, Best Start Grant Early Learning Payment, Best Start Grant School Age Payment and Best Start Foods
Best Start Grant Early Learning and School Age Payments are paid automatically to parents and carers who already receive Scottish Child Payment when their children become eligible.
The Scottish Government estimates that the extended and increased payment could lift 50,000 children out of poverty in 2023/24, a reduction of five percentage points according to the most recent Scottish Government forecasts issued in March 2022.
Families, and carers can find out more and apply at mygov.scot/scottishchildpayment or by calling Social Security Scotland free on 0800 182 2222
Families who already get Scottish Child Payment for a child under the age of six can add older children to their existing award. There is no cap on the number of children in one family who can receive Scottish Child Payment.
Social Security Scotland ran a marketing campaign to raise awareness of the payment tin January. It will run again in March. The Scottish Governmentâ€™s new cost of living website provides information and support for families: gov.scot/costoflivingsupport
Bridging Payments were introduced in 2021 ahead of the roll out of the Scottish Child Payment to under 16s. Families received up to Â£520 per eligible child in 2021 and will receive up to Â£650 in 2022. A final doubled payment was made to families in December 2022.
Where someone applied for Scottish Child Payment before 31 December 2022 and has not received a decision, we have been in contact as we require additional information or evidence to process their application.

                        Â£500,000 more for victimsâ€™ organisations.
                    

Organisations supporting victims and survivors of crime in Scotland will receive a Â£500,000 boost from a fund that takes money from offenders.
Seven organisations â€“ including Victim Support Scotland and Survivors of Human Trafficking in Scotland â€“ will share grant funding to provide practical help directly to victims.
This includes paying for emergency housing costs, meeting food, utility and clothing expenses, and helping with costs to repair or replace damaged property or goods and for mental health services such as counselling.Â 
It is the third tranche of payments from the Victim Surcharge Fund â€“ which comes from the additional penalties imposed on offenders who receive a court fine â€“ since its introduction in 2019.
To date, the Fund has helped more than 1,200 people affected by crime, with around Â£917,000 awardedÂ  â€“ a clear sign of how the Scottish Government continues to prioritise victims.
Justice Secretary Keith Brown said: â€œIt is absolutely right that criminals should pay towards helping victims of crime as they recover from their experience.
â€œOver the past five years we have invested Â£93 million through our justice budget to put victims' rights and needs at the centre of the criminal justice system, demonstrating our commitment to putting victims first.
â€œThis latest funding we are awarding from the Victim Surcharge Fund will help people impacted by crime to access support when they need it most while enabling organisations such as Victim Support Scotland and Survivors of Human Trafficking in Scotland to provide even more help to victims and their families.â€
Kate Wallace, CEO of Victim Support Scotland (VSS) said: â€œConfirmation of this funding means that VSS can continue this vital and life-changing support to people affected by crime and who have no other means of financial support.â€
â€œThe cost-of-living crisis has meant that more people affected by crime are struggling to make ends meet. Funding from the Victim Surcharge Fund allows VSS to provide essential items such as food vouchers, property repairs, alarms and funeral costs, thereby meeting the needs of vulnerable victims immediately following a crime.
â€œSince April 2020, VSS Emergency Assistance Fund has provided Â£903,000 worth of goods to 3,143 people and their families, funded in part through the Victim Surcharge Fund. We accept applications directly from people affected by crime and have received referrals from over 200 support organisations.â€

                        New annual Winter Heating Payment begins
                    

Help with heating costs is on its way to around 400,000 people on low incomes through a new Scottish Government benefit, with the first payments processed this week.
More than Â£20m will be paid out over the course of February and March in Winter Heating Payments.
Winter Heating Payment replaces the Department for Work and Pensionsâ€™ (DWP) Cold Weather Payment. Unlike the DWP benefit it replaces, Winter Heating Payment is not paid only to people when there is a sustained period of cold weather in a specific location, but is a reliable annual Â£50 payment.
Those eligible for Winter Heating Payment will receive it automatically, with no need to apply. It is paid through Social Security Scotland and people will get a letter to let them know they are eligible.
Minister for Social Security Scotland Ben Macpherson said:
â€œOur new Winter Heating Payment is the thirteenth Scottish Government benefit. This year it will provide 400,000 people most in need with a reliable, automatic Â£50 payment to help towards their heating costs.
â€œThe Payment will reach significantly more people than the benefit it has replaced. On average only 185,000 people received the equivalent Cold Weather Payments from the UK Government over the last seven years - whereas we will pay everyone eligible every year.
""The Scottish Government is investing around Â£20 million per year compared with an average of Â£8.3 million annually paid out through Cold Weather Payment. We will also uprate the next Winter Heating Payment by 10.1%, to Â£55.05.â€            ",2/22/2023,"Â£20m to help 400,000 people with heating costs"

                        Extra funding to help offset UK Government benefit cap.
                    

The Scottish Government is providing Â£8.6 million in direct support for people affected by the UK benefit cap as part of its work to tackle child poverty.
An estimated 4,000 families with around 14,000 children are now able to apply for extra financial support through their local councilâ€™s Discretionary Housing Payments scheme.
Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison said:
â€œWe are increasing funding to help bridge the gap between what people need in benefits from the UK Government and what they actually receive. Eligible households could be Â£2,500 better off on average per year as a result.â€œWe will spend up to Â£84 million in 2023-24 on Discretionary Housing Payments to mitigate not only the UK Governmentâ€™s bedroom tax and the on-going freeze to Local Housing Allowance rates, but now also the benefit cap which is pushing families into hardship.â€œOur child poverty targets are ambitious and that is why we are choosing to invest significantly more in social security than the funding we receive from Westminster and helping to mitigate the damaging impact of UK Government welfare cuts.â€John Dickie, Chair of the Child Poverty Action Group, said:â€œMitigating the UK benefit cap is absolutely the right thing to do. Support for struggling families shouldnâ€™t have an arbitrary limit that pushes children into deeper poverty.â€œItâ€™s now vital that everyone affected by the benefit cap applies to their local authority for a Discretionary Housing Payment to replace as far as possible the cash support removed by the cap. The Scottish Government has done the right thing, now the UK Government must act to scrap the cap altogether.â€Laura Millar, Strategic Manager at charity Fife Gingerbread, which helps lone parents and families in need, said:â€œLast year Fife Gingerbread supported the â€˜Scrap the Capâ€™ campaign calling on Westminster to end the benefit cap and the financial hardship this causes. Therefore, the Scottish Governmentâ€™s commitment to empower local authorities to mitigate the impacts of the benefit cap using Discretionary Housing Payments is a positive step.â€œAlthough the number of households affected across Scotland may be relatively small this is an important measure. The greatest risk is that households may be unaware of their entitlement, and every year millions of pounds of benefits go unclaimed. Therefore, we must all raise awareness of this announcement to ensure those most in need of support receive it.â€BackgroundFunding for benefit cap mitigation by Scottish local authorities through Discretionary Housing Payments is as follows:

2022-23


Â£2.6 million


2023-24


Â£6 million

Â£8.6 million

The benefit cap is a UK Government policy which limits the total amount of benefit that most working age people can receive, even if their full entitlement would be higher.

                        Final stage of 2023-24 Budget Bill.
                    

A Scottish Budget which goes further to support the vulnerable and deliver greater benefits than provided in the rest of the UK will be voted on in Parliament.
Ahead of Tuesdayâ€™s final debate and vote on the 2023-24 Scottish Budget Bill, Deputy First Minister John Swinney has set out the â€œsocial contract with every citizen of Scotlandâ€ â€“ supporting people through the cost of living crisis with the groundbreaking Scottish Child Payment, the expansion of free school meals and free bus travel to more than two million people.
Against a background of high inflation and the cost of living crisis, record funding of more than Â£19 billion is committed to the Health and Social Care portfolio â€“ an increase of over Â£1 billion. Other measures include more than Â£350 million for the Council Tax Reduction Scheme which sees 370,000 households paying no council tax, and for business the lowest non-domestic rate poundage in the UK will mean more than 95% of properties are liable for a lower property tax rate than elsewhere.
Investing in Scotlandâ€™s future with more than Â£4.6 billion for the Net Zero, Energy and Transport Portfolio, the Budget also includes Â£467 million to protect the natural environment.
Mr Swinney said:
â€œThis Budget strengthens our social contract with every citizen of Scotland who will continue to enjoy many benefits not available throughout the UK.
â€œIn one of the most challenging budgets since devolution, we are prioritising our limited resources to protect public services, invest in the transition to Net Zero and take decisive steps to eradicate child poverty in Scotland.
â€œSupporting people most in need in these difficult times is the foundation of this Budget. As a Government we are doing all we can to support people and families.
â€œWe have chosen a distinctive, more progressive path where people are asked to pay their fair share to create the fairer society in which we all want to live. Progressive choices on Scottish Income Tax mean that next year this Government will deliver record funding of more than Â£19 billion for health and social care.
â€œWhile none of us should underestimate the scale of the ongoing financial challenges, I am confident that this Budget package offers stability and certainty for Scotland.â€

A quarter of a million Baby Boxes have been delivered to expectant parents â€“ providing them with more than Â£400 worth of essential items for their newborn.
The milestone was reached ahead of the popular schemeâ€™s sixth anniversary in the summer.
Childrenâ€™s Minister Clare Haughey said:
â€œThe Baby Box is part of our commitment to ensure every child has the best start in life, and I am heartened that so many families have benefitted from this fantastic scheme.
â€œClearly household budgets remain under extreme pressure from the cost of living crisis, so it is reassuring to know that all expectant parents in Scotland, regardless of their circumstances, have access to essential items needed for the first six months of their newbornâ€™s life.
""The Baby Box also contains items to support positive parenting, benefitting infants as well as parents.â€
One Parent Families Scotland Chief Executive Satwat Rehman said:
â€œWith rising costs, single parent households are under increasing pressure to meet the costs of looking after their children. Having just one income, with costs associated with a newborn, is very difficult and the essentials contained within the Baby Box go a long way to easing that for single parents.Â We have seen first-hand how much difference this has made to the families we work with.â€
Background
Scotlandâ€™s Baby Box provides families with a range of essential items for the first six months of their babyâ€™s life, delivered in a sturdy cardboard box which can be used as a safe sleeping space during the early months. The contents of the box are designed to inform and support positive parenting behaviours.
APS Group (Scotland), which has the managing agent contract for Scotlandâ€™s Baby Box, conducted a cost analysis which determined that if parents were to buy the box and all the contents individually, the cost would be approximately Â£429.
In an independent evaluation, 97% of parents who took part in research rated the box and its contents as good.

A new campaign will encourage families living on a low income to access local support with finances and work.
It encourages people to take the first step towards relieving these pressures with help from the Parent Club website. This can guide them towards tailored support to help them improve their situation by starting work after unemployment, returning to work or improving earnings.
The campaign which includes TV, radio and online advertising, highlights the pressures of everyday life and shows parents feeling the â€˜walls closing inâ€™ on them as they juggle family life with bills and other costs.
Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison said:Â 
â€œWe understand the anxiety and stress, that low-income families could be living with and the impact of the cost-of-living crisis is likely to be making even worse.
â€œParent Club can guide people to free and confidential tailored advice from local authority employment services, where they can access support relevant to their own work and family situation.
â€œIt also offers information on how to get help from the Money Talk Team who can advise on areas such as maximising income and dealing with debt. Parent Club also provides sources of support with mental health and stress.Â 
â€œTackling child poverty is our national mission. We want to make sure parents know what help is out there and claim any support they should be getting.â€Â 
Chair of Dundeeâ€™s Discover Work Partnership Simon Hewitt said:
â€œParental Employment Support empowers parents to progress towards new or improved employment.Â  The support is delivered in Dundee by ENABLE Works, Barnardoâ€™s, One Parent Families Scotland and Volunteering Matters, with each organisation bringing their own specialist knowledge and experience.
â€œParents can access a variety of support including financial and benefit advice, childcare options, careers guidance, work placements, training and upskill funds, and on-going support from a trained mentor.Â  Support can also be provided to employers to discuss and agree family friendly approaches.Â 
â€œDundeeâ€™s Parental Employment Support is part of our wider Discover Work Service, which provides a range of employability support for all local customers.â€
Citizens Advice Scotland CEO Derek Mitchell said:
â€œWhen times are difficult it can be easy to feel overwhelmed by bills mounting up - but our advice is free, confidential, and impartial.
â€œThe Citizens Advice network is working with the Scottish Government to deliver the Money Talk Team service. We can check to see what payments you might be missing out on or any cheaper deals are available to you. If you are struggling with debt we can help with that too.
â€œDonâ€™t delay, you could be missing out on money that could make a huge difference to you and your familyâ€™s finances.â€

Healthcare staff across Scotland have been offered the largest pay package in the history of the NHS, with a Â£568 million increase in investment.
160,000 NHS Agenda for Change staff â€“ including nurses, midwives, paramedics, allied health professionals, porters and others â€“ will be offered an average 6.5% increase in pay in 2023/24.
This pay offer includes the commitment to deliver the most progressive package of terms and conditions reform in decades.Â 
The offer also includes the commitment to modernising Agenda for Change, which was introduced nearly 20 years ago, to support workforce recruitment, sustainability and retention.
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said:Â 
â€œWe have engaged extensively with trade union representatives over recent weeks, leaving no stone unturned to reach an offer which responds to the key concerns of staff. Our healthcare staff have shown how dedicated and hardworking they are time and again and I cannot thank them enough for their commitment, particularly over the last few challenging years.
â€œOver the two years of this Â£1 billion of increased investment in NHS Agenda for Change, a newly qualified nurse would see their pay increase by 15.8%, and experienced nurses at the top of band 5 would see their pay improve by over Â£4,700.
â€œThis ensures that Scotlandâ€™s NHS Agenda for Change staff are, by far and away, the best paid anywhere in the UK. In fact, for NHS England to catch-up with Scotland the UK Government would need to offer increases in 2023/24 of over 14% at the top of band 5, over 13% at the top of band 6, and over 12% at the top of band 7.
â€œWe have taken difficult decisions to find this money within the health budget because we know that our staff are the very backbone of the NHS and we are committed to supporting them, particularly during a cost of living crisis. I am grateful for the continued efforts around the table and that the trade unions will now put this to their members.""
BACKGROUND
A total of Â£568 million has been committed for Agenda for Change pay in 2023/24. This equates to an average uplift of at least 6.5% for all staff at Band 8a and below.
All staff will also receive a one-off pro rata payment of between Â£387 and Â£939 depending on banding.
The offer also reaffirms previous commitments to work to reduce the working week, protect learning time and review band 5 job nursing profiles.
Examples of increases over the 2 years (2022/23 and 2023/24):
experienced porters (band 2) receive more than Â£3,750 extra (19.1%)

                        Â£27 million to tackle disadvantage.
                    

Community projects tackling poverty and disadvantage will receive Â£27 million funding over the next three years.
Food pantries which help lower food bills and cost of living advice services are among the 100 initiatives developed by local people set to receive grants from the Investing in Communities Fund.
Each supported project is delivering multiple activities, including:
debt and benefit advice to avoid electricity and gas disconnection or eviction for rent arrears in South East Glasgow
a furniture reuse scheme in Inverness and a swap and repair shop in West Lothian
community food growing in South West Glasgow
school uniform exchanges and supporting parents into employment in South Lanarkshire
help for mothers establishing micro businesses in South West Edinburgh
training for jobseekers and counselling to address mental health and substance abuse issues in the Borders
Community Wealth Minister Tom Arthur said:
â€œThis fund will help directly address issues facing disadvantaged communities, such as unemployment and food insecurity.
â€œWe have been clear that the Scottish Budget is prioritising our limited resources to tackle child poverty, invest in our transition to net zero, and protect public services. And the projects supported through Investing in Communities speak to these priorities.
â€œMany will help ease immediate challenges from the cost of living crisis but also support communities in delivering longer term plans to address poverty.â€
Background
Investing in Communities
The full list of projects recommended for support is attached.
The Investing in Communities Fund recognises increased pressure on community organisations from the combined effects of Coronavirus (COVID-19) and the cost of living crisis.

                        Natural Beauty, Tourism and Governance score highly in new survey.
                    

Scotland has achieved its highest ever reported score in an international survey which asks 60,000 adults from 20 countries what their perceptions are of 60 nations.
The Nation Brands Index (NBI) 2022 survey scores and ranks countries across six dimensions including Culture, Tourism, Governance, Immigration and Investment, Exports, and People.
Scotlandâ€™s overall score has jumped to 65.3 out of 100, compared to 62.6 out of 100 in 2020, which is the highest score the Scottish Government has reported since first subscribing to the survey in 2008.
Scotlandâ€™s natural beauty was ranked 7th out of 60, while Tourism ranked 12th out of 60. Tourism also scored the highest, jumping from 68.7 out of 100 in 2020 to 72.3 in 2022.Â  Compared to participating countries, Scotland ranked highly in key areas including ranking 9th for welcoming people, 10th for international peace and security and historic buildings and monuments.
The scoring and ranking of overall Governance has also improved, increasing from 62.9 in 2020 to 64.9 in 2022 and from 13th to 11th place.
Culture Secretary Angus Robertson said:
â€œScotland is blessed with natural beauty, vibrant cities, rich historical sites, white sand beaches and rolling hills, and it is great to see everything we have to offer being recognised by citizens from across the world. It is also encouraging to see that governance in Scotland has also scored well internationally which might be due to international interest in forward thinking and outward looking Scottish Government policies such as the baby box, free period products and our ambitious work to help tackle climate change
â€œDespite Scotlandâ€™s score improving to its highest since we first subscribed to the survey, we will continue to look at ways we can make things better for the people who live here. Itâ€™s been challenging in recent years with the impacts still being suffered from Brexit, the ongoing pandemic and the current cost of living crisis. The survey shows some areas that we can work on and the Scottish Government will leave no stone unturned in doing so.â€
Background
The survey was conducted by Anholt-Ipsos polling between 5 July and 11 August 2022.
Twenty panel countries were selected for the survey of the 2022 Nation Brands Index study, representing major developed and developing countries that play important and diverse roles in international relations, trade and the flow of business, and cultural and tourism activities.

                        Funding will help tackle social impact of rising cost of living.
                    

Projects supporting people most at risk of social isolation and loneliness will receive a share of almost Â£1 million support funding announced today.
The money will help to provide warm spaces, hot meals, group activities and fuel payments to people most at risk of isolation including older people, young parents, carers and disabled people.
Organisations to receive grants/funds include Age Scotland, who will continue to deliver their â€˜Keeping The Doors Openâ€™ grants programme, and Chest, Heart and Stroke Scotland who are recruiting Urdu and Punjabi-speaking volunteers to make Kindness Calls.
Equalities and Older Peopleâ€™s Minister Christina McKelvie said:
â€œSocial isolation and loneliness can affect anyone, especially at this time of year when people can struggle to get outside and socialise. The pandemic and the cost of living crisis have increased isolation for some people, including young people, carers and disabled people.
â€œThe funding will be a lifeline for a range of organisations who are helping to keep people connected during this challenging time.
â€œThis fund is just one of the many crucial steps that we are taking to tackle social isolation and loneliness as part of our plan, A Connected Scotland.â€
Chest, Heart & Stroke Scotlandâ€™s Chief Executive Jane-Claire Judson said:
â€œWe know that living with a disability or long-term condition can be hugely isolating and that for those who are unable to read or communicate fluently in English, this isolation can be even more significant.
â€œThis funding from the Scottish Government will greatly enhance the ability of our support services to reach non-English speaking and minority ethnic populations in Scotland to reduce isolation and loneliness.
â€œUltimately, it will allow us to engage with and support more people across Scotland who are living with chest, heart and stroke conditions, better enabling them to live their lives to the full.â€
Chief Executive of Age Scotland Mark Oâ€™Donnell said
â€œOlder peopleâ€™s groups have an incredibly important role in communities across Scotland, supporting health and wellbeing, physical activity, tackling loneliness and food insecurity. Our research has identified that around 200,000 over-65s rely on groups like this but the impact of Covid-19 and spiralling inflation has meant that these lifelines have been facing incredible pressures to keeping their doors open. Weâ€™re incredibly grateful that the Scottish Government took notice of our research and our ask of greater financial support for older peopleâ€™s groups.
â€œThe funding will help many such groups and clubs meet the rising cost of energy bills, food, transport and venues to meet, ensuring that their members can stay connected and are able to be as well as they can be.â€

                        Non-Domestic Rates legislation.
                    

New draft legislation on non-domestic rates (NDR) aims to tackle tax avoidance and promote the Scottish Governmentâ€™s ground-breaking Deposit Return Scheme.
Regulations laid before the Scottish Parliament will empower councils to crack down on tax-avoidance such as the artificial use of insolvency, leasing arrangements or shell companies.
They would also make owners of non-domestic properties liable for payment, rather than the propertyâ€™s occupiers, and allow for liability for payment to be backdated if an offence is repeated within a five-year period.
In a separate move, parts of properties solely used to house reverse vending machines, which refund users for recycling drinks containers, would be exempt from NDR. This will support businesses to get ready for Scotlandâ€™s Deposit Return scheme.
Further amendments to NDR, announced in the Scottish Budget 2023-24, will be published shortly as part of a package of regulations to provide more help for businesses through the current cost of living crisis.
Public Finance Minister Tom Arthur said:
â€œThe Scottish Government is committed to a fair and transparent system of non-domestic rates which supports businesses and communities.
â€œIt is important that everyone pays their share and these regulations will help tackle those who seek to find loopholes to avoid payment.
â€œWe want to ensure that parts of properties used for reverse vending machines are not liable to pay rates. This will incentivise and promote Scotlandâ€™s Deposit Return Scheme which will launch on 16 August this year.
â€œSubject to the regulations passing in the Scottish Parliament, we will work to ensure Scotlandâ€™s non-domestic rates system remains progressive and in line with our net zero ambitions.â€
Background
TheÂ Non-Domestic Rates (Miscellaneous Anti-Avoidance Measures) (Scotland) Regulations 2023 will deliver on a commitment in the Bute House Agreement to help local authorities tackle tax avoidance tactics, including when they make decisions on applying empty property relief and charity relief.
The Non-Domestic Rating (Valuation of Sites of Reverse Vending Machines) (Scotland) Regulations 2023 will ensure the part of a non-domestic property used solely in the provision or use of a reverse vending machine, is not liable for rates.
The Scottish Budget 2023-24 announced the lowest poundage in the UK for the fifth year in a row and a package of reliefs worth an estimated Â£744 million.
Draft regulations are laid in order to be considered by Parliament before they are signed into law. These new regulations should come into force in Scotland on 1 April 2023.
Scotlandâ€™s Deposit Return Scheme, the first of its kind in the UK, will launch on 16 August 2023. It will be a major part of the Scottish Governmentâ€™s efforts to reduce littering and cut emissions by creating return points for recycling drinks containers.

                        Survey launched to understand international interests and aspirations.
                    

A public survey to help develop an International Culture Strategy for Scotland has been launched by the Culture Secretary.
The survey seeks views from cultural organisations, companies from across the creative industries and individuals who work internationally or have aspirations to do so. The strategy aims to develop an approach to international engagement that supports sectoral resilience, recovery and long term development.
The strategy will seek to draw on the knowledge, expertise and lived experience of cultural organisations and practitioners to understand the importance of international activity to their work and to the wider sector in Scotland.
The survey will be open for responses for three months and will form the basis of a report that will be published after a period of analysis.
Culture Secretary Angus Robertson said:
â€œWorking in partnership with the sector, the Scottish Government is developing an International Culture Strategy that supports the international aspirations and potential of Scotlandâ€™s culture sector, building on its strong existing international footprint.
â€œThe strategy will be set in the context of the challenges facing the sector following the impact of Brexit, the Covid pandemic and the cost of living crisis and ensure it helps address these challenges. That is why this survey is so important as once we begin to see themes emerging, we can engage further with the sector to explore these themes in more detail.
â€œScotlandâ€™s cultural activity has a strong international reputation, which is important to our wider international presence. I hope as many people and organisations as possible engage with this survey to allow us to create a strategy that best supports the sectorâ€™s international activity and ambitions.â€

                        Scottish Budget 2023-24 reaches Stage One vote.
                    

Deputy First Minister John Swinney is urging MSPs to back the Scottish Governmentâ€™s Budget for 2023-24, as it â€œdelivers for the people of Scotlandâ€.
Speaking ahead of todayâ€™s Stage One Budget Bill debate, Mr Swinney said that in a difficult financial environment the Budget focused resources on the three key priorities of delivering sustainable public services, transforming the economy to deliver a just transition to net zero and taking direct action to eradicate child poverty.
It includes more than Â£13 billion for health and social care and Â£1 billion for early learning and childcare provision.
It also supports those hardest hit by the cost of living crisis, with Â£442 million invested in the unique Scottish Child Payment and Â£20 million for the Fuel Insecurity Fund to help households at risk of self-disconnection or self-rationing their energy use.
Mr Swinney said:
â€œThese are fair and ambitious spending plans for the coming year which have been developed during one of the most challenging financial environments since devolution.
â€œTo govern is to choose and we have chosen a different, distinctive path that commits substantial resources to protect the most vulnerable from the impact of decisions made by the UK Government.
â€œWe are asking people to contribute to a fairer society that provides benefits such as free prescriptions, free access to higher education and concessionary travel not available in other parts of the UK.
â€œThe progressive choices we propose on Scottish income tax also mean that next year the Scottish Government can direct additional investment towards our NHS. That investment will help drive forward our recovery plan, improve primary health care services and help reduce the harms associated with drugs and alcohol.
â€œAt the same time, the majority of people in Scotland will still be paying less in Income Tax than if they lived in the rest of the UK. The Budget also delivers the number one ask of businesses by freezing the non-domestic rates poundage and providing a package of reliefs worth an estimated Â£744 million.
â€œOur spending plans will help ensure we can deliver a net zero future achieved through sustainable economic growth. We are investing Â£1.4 billion to maintain, improve and decarbonise Scotlandâ€™s rail network and almost Â£467 million on peatland restoration. And by doubling the budget for the next phase of the Just Transition Fund to Â£50 million, we are helping regional economies in the North East and Moray move away from the industries contributing to the climate emergency and diversify into others.
â€œThis is a meaningful and progressive Budget that delivers for the people of Scotland. I urge all MSPs to unite behind it.â€

                        550 disabled people supported to access Scottish social security benefits.
                    

A free independent advocacy service to support disabled people to access Scottish Government benefits has marked its first year in operation.
The Scottish Government is investing more than Â£20 million to deliver this service over the course of four years. This independent service is available to people with a disability who may need extra support. This could include people with a sensory disability, mental health condition or learning disability. The service is also available to parents or carers who need support to access benefits for a child.
The service, which was introduced in January 2022, enables disabled people to be more involved in the processes and decisions which affect them and advocates will provide the most appropriate form of support to each individual based on their circumstances.
Minister for Social Security Ben Macpherson said:
â€œI am delighted that, in its first year, the Independent Advocacy Service has supported over 550 people applying for Scottish Government social security benefits.
â€œThe service is a key part of our human rights approach to social security and how the values of dignity, fairness and respect in our social security system work in practice.
â€œThe service helping disabled people to access the financial support they are entitled to, and is delivering on our commitment to make our system as inclusive as possible.
â€œWith the Scottish Governmentâ€™s commitment to invest more than Â£20 million in it, the advocacy service will be able to assist even more disabled people access the help they are entitled to over the coming years.â€
CEO of VoiceAbility, Jonathan Senker said:
â€œOver our first year of delivering the Independent Advocacy Service, people tell me that it enabled them to apply for social security benefits when before they felt daunted by the process. They say that advocates supported them to express themselves openly, when previously they felt obliged to â€˜put on a brave faceâ€™ or underplay their needs.
â€œItâ€™s vital that people can access the benefits to which they are entitled. I am proud of VoiceAbilityâ€™s skilled team of advocates, who are ready and available to support disabled people across Scotland. I encourage anyone who thinks an advocate could help them to access benefits to contact us. Weâ€™re here on the phone, online and in-person to make sure youâ€™re heard when it matters.â€
Background
The service was introduced in January 2022, ahead of a pilot for Adult Disability Payment â€“ which replaces Personal Independence Payment (PIP) in Scotland. Adult Disability Payment was introduced across Scotland in August 2022.
The service is independent of the Scottish Government and is delivered by VoiceAbility, a charity with 40 yearsâ€™ experience of delivering independent advocacy services.
The service provides free advocacy to anyone who self-identifies as disabled who requires support to engage effectively with Social Security Scotland.
Advocacy is available throughout the whole of the process for seeking support; from the point of application, through to any request for redetermination and appeals.
People can access this support by contacting VoiceAbility directly for free on 0300 303 1660 or by visiting voiceability.org
People can also access this support by calling Social Security Scotland for free on 0800 182 2222 and asking to be referred to the Independent Advocacy Service.            ",1/26/2023,Independent Advocacy Service celebrates one year anniversary

                        Campaign aims to help fill vacant posts.
                    

A marketing campaign to support the recruitment of more adult social care workers has launched this week, to help address the high level of vacancies in the sector.
The campaign â€“ titled â€˜there is more to care than caringâ€™ - will raise awareness of the career opportunities available in adult social care and encourage people to apply. Activity includes radio, outdoor and digital advertising, highlighting the important work done by adult social care workers.
It is part of the Scottish Governmentâ€™s commitment to attract more people to work in adult social care, retain existing staff and raise its status as a profession. This builds on a pay uplift for all adult social care staff which guarantees them a minimum of at least Â£10.90 an hour from this April.
Today, Social Care Minister Kevin Stewart visited Leuchie House, in North Berwick to see the work it does to support people affected by stroke, multiple sclerosis and neurological conditions.
Mr Stewart said:
â€œWorking in adult social care can be challenging but offers the opportunity to have a hugely positive impact on peopleâ€™s lives on a daily basis.
â€œWe are increasing pay, improving terms and conditions in the sector, and developing clear career pathways for the workforce, ahead of the introduction of the National Care Service. This will lead to more rewarding roles for the existing adult social care workforce, and for new entrants to the profession.

                        Minister urges people to check eligibility for support.
                    

People struggling to pay their council tax during the cost of living crisis are being encouraged to check if they are eligible for money off their bill.
The Council Tax Reduction (CTR) scheme is unique to Scotland and helps people on low incomes save an average of Â£750 a year on their council tax bill. Those eligible can also save up to 35% on their water and waste charges.
The latest figures published by the Scottish Government show 455,220 recipients received CTR in November 2022, meaning around one-in-five households were benefitting from the scheme.
Public Finance Minister Tom Arthur visited Citizens Advice and Rights Fife today (Wednesday 25 January) to meet staff advising people on dealing with the cost of living crisis. He said:
â€œWe know that this cost of living crisis is hammering people on lower incomes and those already living in poverty. It is vital that people know where to go to get advice and support.
â€œThe Council Tax Reduction scheme will celebrate its tenth anniversary in April and Scottish households have saved more than Â£3 billion on their council tax since it was introduced. The support it provides has never been more important and I urge people to check whether they are eligible.
â€œInformation can be obtained from your local Citizens Advice Bureau â€“ like the excellent facility I visited in Glenrothes today â€“ local councils and the Money Talk Team service promoted by the Scottish Government, as well as online.â€
Chief Executive Officer of Citizens Advice and Rights Fife, David Redpath, said:
â€œWe are experiencing unprecedented demand for advice on how to maximise incomes to the cost of living crisis.
â€œCouncil Tax Reduction plays a key role in making budgets stretch further and we encourage people to check if they are eligible for a reduction, discount or even an exemption from paying council tax.
â€œCitizens Advice and Rights Fife is here to help people find ways to ease the cost of living whether that is council tax or any other daily living costs.â€
Background:
The Council Tax Reduction scheme assesses a householdâ€™s income, capital and circumstances so is open to all, including people not in receipt of benefits.
People can check whether they are eligible for CTR through mygov.scot or by contacting their local council. Details of other help available including extra financial support or help with things like food, heating and electricity can be found on the Scottish Governmentâ€™s cost of living crisis support website.

                        Minister confirms intention to cap rents at 3%.
                    

Emergency measures to protect tenants will be extended, Tenants Rightsâ€™ Minister Patrick Harvie has confirmed, with private rents capped and enforcement of evictions prevented in most cases.Â 
Subject to the approval of Parliament, changes to the Cost of Living (Tenant Protection) Act will mean that from 1 April 2023:Â 
If landlords choose to increase private rents they will be capped at 3%
The safeguard for private landlords will be amended, allowing them to apply for increases of up to 6% to help cover certain increases in costs in defined and limited circumstances
Enforcement of evictions will continue to be prevented for all tenants except in a number of specified circumstances
Increased damages for unlawful evictions of up to 36 monthsâ€™ worth of rent will continue to be applicable
The rent cap for student accommodation will be suspended, recognising its limited impact on annual rents set on the basis of an academic year
These temporary measures are intended to be extended to 30 September, provided they remain necessary, with the option to extend for another six-month period if required.Â 
As announced in December 2022, the social sector rent freeze is being replaced with agreements from landlords to keep any rent increase for 2023-24 well below inflation.Â 
Mr Harvie said:Â 
â€œOur emergency legislation has helped protect tenants facing the cost of living crisis. With many households still struggling with bills, it is clear that these protections are still needed to give tenants greater confidence about their housing costs and the security of a stable home.Â 
â€œWhile the primary purpose of the legislation is to support tenants, I recognise that costs have been rising for landlords too. Thatâ€™s why we intend to allow those in the private sector to increase rents by up to 3%, with a continued safeguard allowing them to apply for larger increases to cover specified rising costs they might be seeing as landlords. By allowing increases in rent â€“ capped well below inflation and limited to once per 12 months â€“ we can continue protecting tenants from the minority of landlords who would impose unaffordable rent hikes.Â 
â€œWe will continue to carefully monitor the impacts of this legislation, working with tenants and landlords to protect them from this costs crisis.â€Â 
BackgroundÂ 
Further information on the Cost of Living (Tenant Protection) Act is available on the Scottish Government website.
The evictions moratorium prevents enforcement of eviction actions resulting from the cost of living crisis except in a number of specified circumstances.Â 
Landlords can apply to Rent Service Scotland (RSS) to increase rent to partially cover specific costs including increased mortgage interest payments on the property they are letting, an increase in landlordsâ€™ insurance or increases in service charges paid as part of a tenancy, subject to an overall limit. This limit is currently set at 3% of total rent. From 1 April it will be increased to 6%.Â In effect this retains the status quo of allowable rent rises of 3% above the cap. As set out in theÂ first report on the Act to the Scottish Parliament, as at 31 December 2022 RSS had received only 12 applications of this nature, of which 10 were valid.Â 
Under theÂ agreement on social rents for 2023-24, COSLA has committed to keeping local authority rent increases to an average of no more than Â£5 a week. Members of the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations and Glasgow West of Scotland Forum of Housing Associations have reported planned increases averaging 6.1%.

                        Pragmatic approach to support hosts during cost of living crisis.
                    

Recognising the pressures short-term lets hosts face at this time, legislation has been laid to extend the deadline for applying for a licence by six months to 1 October 2023.
The new deadline applies to anyone operating as a host before 1 October 2022. Anyone who started operating after that must have applied for and obtained a licence before accepting guests and bookings.
Housing Secretary Shona Robison said:
â€œWe are taking a pragmatic approach to help support hosts in recognition of the wider cost of living crisis that is placing pressure on businesses. This one-off six-month extension will give businesses more time to spread the cost of the licence fee, and meet the scheme requirements.
â€œThe principal component of our licencing scheme is a mandatory set of safety standards which many hosts will already be meeting as a matter of best practice or compliance with existing law. Our scheme gives local authorities the powers to strike a balance between the economic and tourism benefits of short-term lets and community concerns.
â€œMany hosts have already applied for a licence. I encourage those that have yet to do so to apply for a licence well in advance of the extended deadline.â€
Background
New hosts must now apply for, and obtain, a licence before accepting bookings or receiving guests. Anyone who operating as a host before 1 October 2022 can operate as normal while their application is being determined.
In December 2022 the Housing Secretary issued a letter to the Housing and Planning Committee confirming the intentions to amend the deadline of the scheme in the new year.

                        Cash-first approach will help those facing hardship.
                    

Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison has announced an additional Â£2.4 million in funding to help people struggling to afford food and other essentials.
The funds will go to four organisations to distribute mainly on a â€˜cash-firstâ€™ basis to people in immediate need in the face of the cost of living crisis.
A focus on crisis payments and shopping cards will allow people to choose for themselves what they need.
Ms Robison announced the funding on a visit to Prospect Community Housing in Wester Hailes, Edinburgh, where she heard how staff are helping residents through debt and income advice services.
She said:
â€œI know people are struggling with the cost of food and other essentials right now, and this additional funding will get more support to some of those who need it most this winter.
â€œWe are working with partners to prioritise urgent cash-first action when it comes to food insecurity and this will take some of the pressure off food banks.
â€œThis funding has the potential to directly reach 7,500 people, and many more will benefit than this, as the Corra Foundation and Fareshare will between them distribute it further to an estimated 900 organisations.
â€œWe want people to make sure they are getting all the support they are entitled to, so I encourage anyone who is struggling financially to get advice on what support they may qualify for - through their local authority, a local advice service, or Social Security Scotland as well as checking out our cost of living website.â€
Carolyn Sawers, Chief Executive at the Corra Foundation said:
â€œThis Â£1 million contribution to the Household Hardship Fund from the Scottish Government provides a dignified cash first approach for those most impacted by the cost of living.
â€œOrganisations which have received money through the fund have told us it is making a significant difference helping families with the essentials of food, fuel, and household items.
â€œCorra is committed to working alongside others in tackling the long-term issues of poverty. The Household Hardship fund is an important step in responding to the crisis that people across Scotland face today.â€
Sally Thomas, Chief Executive of the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations (SFHA), said:
â€œHousing associations and co-operatives are doing everything they can to help tenants keep their heads above water, heat their homes and put food on their table this winter. HoweverÂ  our members are increasingly reporting that tenants are facing impossible decisions on and between household bills and food as costs soar.
â€œItâ€™s simply not right that anyone in Scotland should be going hungry this winter. As we continue to face this unprecedented crisis, this money will be critical to helping ensure social landlords can provide a response to food insecurity that is tailored to the needs of their tenants and communities, maintaining dignity and choice.â€
Background 
Allocations from the Â£2.4 million:
Â£1,000,000 to the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations for cash-first responses to food insecurity via their members
Â£1,050,000 to Corra Foundation for their Household Hardship Fund, providing grants to organisations working to alleviate poverty with an emphasis on cash-first responses food insecurity
Â£100,000 to Citizens Advice Scotland to expand their shopping card pilot, offering an alternative to a food bank referral
Â£250,000 to FareShare for regional purchasing where needed to supplement the supply from surplus and donations
In 2022-23 the Scottish Government has allocated around Â£3 billion in a range of measures which will help mitigate the impacts of the cost of living crisis on households, of which Â£1 billion is for support only available in Scotland and not elsewhere in the UK.
The Scottish Government consulted on a draft plan on ending the need for food banks between October 2021 and January 2022, and the plan will be published in the coming months.

                        Money could be available to help get through the cost of living crisis
                    

People are being encouraged to check they are not missing out on money and to find out if they could be eligible for any of the 12 benefits administered by Social Security Scotland. Seven of these are only available in Scotland.
The benefits which have been introduced over the past four years are available to people on low incomes responsible for children under 16, for people who need help paying for a funeral, disabled people, carers, young people entering the workplace and to help heat their homes.
Four of these payments are made automatically to people who get other qualifying benefits. To make sure people are maximising their income they should check what DWP benefits they could be eligible for too.
Payments made automatically include Carerâ€™s Allowance Supplement and Child Winter Heating Payment as well as Best Start Grant Early Learning Payment and Best Start Grant School Age Payment for those in receipt of Scottish Child Payment.
In addition, the new Winter Heating Payment will be paid automatically to an expected 400,000 people across Scotland when it is introduced in February.Â Â 
Minister for Social Security Ben Macpherson said:
â€œJanuary is traditionally a month where people find it harder financially than the rest of the year. This pressure can be more acute for people on low incomes or who face additional costs due to a disability or ill-health condition. The cost of living crisis also means that people are facing difficult financial decisions day in and day out.
â€œWe are committed to making sure that people are getting all of the money that they are entitled to. That is why we are making payments automatically where we can. Where people need to apply, we are working hard to promote these payments and make the process of accessing them as straightforward as possible.
â€œSocial Security Scotland works with partners and through advertising to promote our benefits and our next campaign will start this month to encourage parents and carers to apply for Scottish Child Payment.
â€œPeople can apply for all our benefits online, by phone, through the post or in person â€“ whatever works best for them. Weâ€™ve designed the way we promote and deliver these benefits with the people who they are for to make sure that what we do works for them.
â€œWe want people to talk with others they know about the support that is available. These payments are a shared investment in building a fairer society and no one should think twice about accessing what they are entitled to. Please look into what is available and apply if you think you could be eligible.â€

More than 180 projects across rural Scotland will receive grants ranging from Â£100,000 to several hundred pounds, from the Rural & Island Communities Ideas into Action (RICIA) fund.
The fund encourages and supports not-for-profit community groups with innovative approaches to community-led local development, including work towards net zero and just transition goals, tackling rural poverty and supporting rural communities through the cost of living crisis.
Supported projects include:
building of mountain bike trails to bring in new visitors and provide sports opportunities to the local community
opening up of a community hall as a â€˜warm spaceâ€™ over the winter months and providing suppers to alleviate rising costs
purchase of educational equipment by a community centre to benefit the mental health of children, and
installation of solar thermal panels at a community hub to help manage electricity costs.
The funding is being delivered in partnership between the Scottish Government and Inspiring Scotland.
Rural Affairs Secretary Mairi Gougeon said:

                        Prof. John McKendrick to continue pushing progress on widening HE participation.
                    

ProfessorÂ John McKendrick has been appointed as the new Commissioner for Fair Access to Higher Education in Scotland.
Currently Professor of Social Justice at Glasgow Caledonian University, he will work across Scotlandâ€™s education system to champion increased representation at university for students from the countryâ€™s most deprived areas.
Prof McKendrick succeeds Prof Sir Peter Scott who stepped down as Scotland's inaugural Commissioner for Fair Access last year after six years in the role.
The Scottish Government is committed to ensuring that students from the 20% most deprived communities will represent 20% of entrants to Scottish universities by 2030, and steady progress has been made towards this in recent years.
Minister for Higher Education, Further Education, Youth Employment & Training Jamie Hepburn said:
â€œI would like to thank Peter Scott for his tireless hard work and effort during his time as Commissioner. I have no doubt that Prof McKendrick will bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to the role, alongside a strong passion for widening access to higher education.
""More students from our most deprived areas are attending university than ever before â€“ we have already exceeded the first interim target to have 16% of all entrants to Scottish universities from the 20% most deprived areas.
""This progress is extremely encouraging, but we know we have more to do.Â Prof McKendrickâ€™s appointment provides an excellent opportunity to continue to drive progress on fairer access to higher education for all at such a pivotal juncture.â€
Prof McKendrick said:
""It is a great honour to be appointed Commissioner for Fair Access and I relish the opportunity of working with those committed to tackling inequalities in access.
""Progress has been made toward meeting the ambitious 2030 target to widen access, but the world in which we live has changed. The Covid pandemic and now the cost-of-living crisis have intensified the problemsÂ for those already facing most disadvantage.
""We now need to upscale our efforts to widen access in Higher Education, if Scotland is to prosper as a high-skill economy, and to do so as an inclusive society.""
Background
Recent UCAS dataÂ  has shown that the number of 18-year-olds securing university places from the most deprived areas has increased since 2019 by 31% to a record high â€“ demonstrating the progress Scotland is making on widening access. Additionally, acceptances from all ages groups in the most deprived areas increased by 4% since the UCAS cycle of 2019, which is the last year exams took place before the pandemic.
Prof McKendrick formally takes up the role as Commissioner for Fair Access on January 10.
John McKendrick is Professor of Social Justice at Glasgow Caledonian University and Co-Director of the Scottish Poverty & Inequality Research Unit. He has dedicated a career to tackling inequality and poverty in Scotland and has managed projects for and worked closely with a number of organisations in civil society and the public sector, including The Poverty Alliance, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Child Poverty Action Group.
Prof McKendrick also has a particular interest in equity in secondary and tertiary education and has led the evaluation of Glasgow Caledonian Universityâ€™s flagship widening participation scheme, the Caledonian Club.            ",1/4/2023,New Commissioner for Fair Access

First-time buyers and others on low to medium incomes are being encouraged to take advantage of the Open Market Shared Equity Scheme to help buy a home in 2023.

The scheme allows people to buy a home without having to fund its entire cost and is available across Scotland to these people who face particular barriers to the housing market:

people aged 60 and over
 first time buyers
 social renters (people who rent from the council or a housing association)
 disabled people
 members of the armed forces
 veterans who have left the armed forces within the past two years
 widows, widowers and other bereaved partners of service personnel for up to two years after their partner has lost their life while serving
Housing Secretary Shona Robison said:

â€œWe recognise the challenges people are facing in this cost of living crisis and we want to help as many people as possible to buy an affordable home this new year.

â€œThis scheme puts applicants on a more level playing field with other buyers when purchasing an affordable home. Buyers can purchase a share of a property while holding the full title, with the Scottish Government funding the remaining share under a shared equity agreement.

â€œScotland continues to be a great place to buy a first home and has led the way in the delivery of affordable housing across the UK. We have now delivered almost 113,000 affordable homes since 2007, over 79,000 of which were for social rent.

â€œIf youâ€™re from one of the priority groups and would like to own a home, Iâ€™d encourage you to consider the Open Market Shared Equity scheme.â€

Background

Open Market Shared Equity scheme

Open Market Shared Equity scheme information leaflet

In August 2022 the eligibility of the scheme was widened to put applicants on a more level playing field with other buyers when purchasing an affordable home.

The threshold of the Open Market Shared Equity Scheme â€“ which allows people to buy a home without having to fund its entire cost â€“ has been raised by 9% across the country to reflect rising house prices.

Thresholds are set at the lowest 25% of house prices in urban areas and the lowest 50% of house prices in rural areas.

Through the Open Market Shared Equity scheme, buyers pay for the biggest share which is usually between 60% and 90% of the home's cost.            ",1/3/2023,Supporting home ownership this new year

                        Two year anniversary of the end of the transition period.
                    

The people of Scotland must be given a choice about their future given the damage inflicted by Brexit, Constitution Secretary Angus Robertson has said.
Marking two years since the end of the transition period to leave the European Union after 47 years of membership, Mr Robertson highlighted the negative impacts Brexit continues to have on Scotlandâ€™s economy.
Constitution Secretary Angus Robertson said:
â€œThe damages caused by Brexit just continue to mount. In the two years since the end of the transition period, we have seen no advantages to leaving the European Union. The cost of living crisis and recession are being felt more deeply in the UK than anywhere else, with recent research showing food bills in the UK are Â£210 higher in the last two years due to Brexit. Households on the lowest incomes are the hardest hit.
â€œThe UK economy is fundamentally on the wrong path and there is no real alternative on offer within the current system. The Scottish Government is committed to giving the people of Scotland a choice about the future they want â€“ a greener, wealthier and fairer economy within the European Union, or a sluggish, stagnating economy outside of the European Union. We will continue to publish the Building a New Scotland series of prospectus papers to ensure people can make that informed choice.
â€œAccording to the Office for Budget Responsibility, UK GDP is expected to be 4% lower as a consequence of Brexit â€“ this equates to around Â£100 billion in output and Â£40 billion in public revenues lost each and every year. Businesses are suffering from lower exports to the EU, labour shortages and recruitment challenges. These issues are also affecting our NHS, with new research by the Nuffield Trust showing that lower EU migration is exacerbating staff shortages.
â€œScotland is and always has been a proud European nation and weâ€™re determined to continue to be an active and constructive participant on EU matters, which will ease the process of Scotlandâ€™s future return to the EU. This is in stark contrast to the approach being taken by the UK Government, intent on undermining retained EU law which will be hugely damaging to people and businesses in Scotland.â€

The introduction of Adult Disability Payment, further automation and the increase and extension of Scottish Child Payment has seen more people apply for and get financial support they are entitled to.
Thousands of people have also had their benefit awards transferred to Social Security Scotland from the Department of Work and Pensions.
In March, Adult Disability Payment, which replaces the UK Governmentâ€™s Personal Independence Payment and is the most complex benefit to be introduced so far, was launched as a pilot project before being made available to eligible disabled adults aged 16 to state pension age in Scotland at the end of August.
In November, Scottish Child Payment increased to Â£25 and was extended to include eligible children up to age 16 and around 385,000 children are now expected to be eligible.
At the same time, Social Security Scotland introduced further automation. Families and carers who already get Scottish Child Payment will now automatically be paid Best Start Grant Early Learning and School Age payments when their child is eligible.
Automatic payments continued for around 90,000 carers eligible for the December payment of Carers Allowance Supplement, as well as around 23,000 disabled children and young people who received Child Winter Heating Assistance to help heat their homes.
Minister for Social Security Ben Macpherson said:
â€œThere is no doubt that 2022 has been the biggest and most complex year yet for Social Security Scotland. Creating a new social security system at pace has not been a simple task, but the progress made since 2018 has been substantial.
â€œIntroducing Adult Disability Payment to replace the DWPâ€™s Personal Independence Payment was a significant milestone in the growth of the Scottish social security system and marked a step change, delivering an improved experience for disabled people that is compassionate and rooted in trust.
â€œWith many people facing financial hardship during the ongoing cost of living crisis, extending the Scottish Child Payment to under 16 year olds means that now hundreds of thousands more children will get much needed extra financial support.
â€œInvesting in social security is a priority for the Scottish Government. Our commitment in the 2023-24 Budget to uprate benefits by 10.1% will mean more support going to people on low-incomes, disabled people, carers and young people right across Scotland at a time when many are facing tough financial challenges.
â€œThough there is still much work to do, we are creating a system to be proud of Â and building strong foundations to serve Scotland for generations to come, treating people with dignity, fairness and respect. Social security is a human right and an investment in creating a fairer society, together.â€
Dad Martin, whose daughter has learning difficulties, says receiving benefits helped his daughter flourish.
He said: â€œI went on the website and applied for Child Disability Payment. When I got accepted I went from having nothing at the end of the month to having Â£97 left. This enabled me to do so many things with my daughter and because of that she has flourished.â€
Another young woman who received the Young Carerâ€™s Grant this year, said: â€œIt had a positive impact because I needed new clothes so I spent about Â£100 on clothes and then I shared the rest of the grant with my brother and sister.â€
A mum who received School Age Payment for their child said: â€œI applied for this grant for my child when she started primary one. It was a great help to us to cover the costs of school uniforms and accessories required for school. I would urge all parents to apply for this grant.â€

                        Minister says Shared Prosperity Fund â€˜fails communitiesâ€™.
                    

Scotland is missing out on more than Â£300 million in European support under the UK Governmentâ€™s replacement funding programme.
As the first payments are made to local authorities through the UK Shared Prosperity Fund, Employment Minister Richard Lochhead said Scotland is suffering from a 60% shortfall in financial help.
The UK Government promised its UK Shared Prosperity Fund would replace in full all EU funding lost to Scotland after Brexit.Â But it has only allocated Â£212 million to Scotland over a three-year period, when EU funding would have been worth around Â£549 million over three years â€“ a shortfall of Â£337 million.
The new fund is distributed exclusively through local authorities, excluding national, community and Third Sector groups, risking the loss of the services which these organisations provided.Â The UK Government has also taken sole responsibility for use of the funds; previously the Scottish Government allocated EU funding to ensure the needs of Scotlandâ€™s people and communities were properly met.
Mr Lochhead said:
â€œEU structural funds have made a real difference across the country, helping more people into work and delivering new skills through better training and support. This welcome contribution from the EU has been eradicated by Brexit and the UK Governmentâ€™s replacement for EU funding has fallen far short in both the quality and quantity of what is required.
â€œThe UK Government has ignored the devolution settlement and failed to recognise the authority of the Scottish Government in devolved areas. This replacement for EU funding ought to be fully devolved, allowing funding to flow to regions and communities in line with shared Scottish policies, designed to best serve Scottish needs.
â€œShared Prosperity has also left local authorities racing against the clock to spend their funding by March, or face losing it and see their plans reduced to tatters due to the UK Governmentâ€™s delay in only now agreeing the allocations.
â€œThe approach taken thus far by the UK Government is against the principles of partnership working and risks diluting Scottish Government efforts to transform the economy and support families and sustainable public services during this cost of living crisis.â€
Background
The UK Shared Prosperity Fund sees Scotland allocated Â£32 million in 2022-2023, Â£55 million in 2023-24 and Â£125 million in 2024-25. Even the third year of funding delivers less than Scotland received before the UKâ€™s EU Exit.
The Scottish Government has calculated Â£162 million per year would be needed to replace the European Regional Development Fund and European Social Fund, increasing to Â£183 million per year when LEADER funding and the EU Territorial Cooperation Programmes are added in.
Shared Prosperity funding is allocated over three years but delivered as single year payments and any underspend must be returned by local authorities to the UK Government at the end of each year.
EU funding has supported infrastructure projects and community initiatives across the country since the 1970s, with Scotland receiving and delivering more than Â£6 billion. Transformational projects, such as the University of the Highlands and Islands and the European Marine Energy Centre in Orkney, have brought significant benefits to businesses and communities.
Projects previously supported by European Territorial Cooperation grants have included a scheme using video technology to help dementia patients stay at home rather than go into residential care, and a scheme developing tools powered by zero emissions hydrogen.

                        Minister urges those eligible to apply for support with the cost of living.
                    

Scottish households have saved more than Â£3 billion in council tax since the Council Tax Reduction (CTR) scheme was introduced almost ten years ago.
The latest figures published by the Scottish Government show 456,790 recipients received CTR in October 2022, meaning around one-in-five households were benefiting from the scheme.
People on low incomes are eligible for CTR if they live in Scotland â€“ there is no equivalent benefit in England where most councils require each household to contribute a minimum amount of council tax, irrespective of ability to do so.
People who receive CTR save on average Â£750 a year and become eligible for up to 35% off their water and waste charges.
Public Finance Minister Tom Arthur said:
â€œThe Council Tax Reduction scheme celebrates its tenth anniversary in April 2023 and these latest figures show the scale of support it has provided to people in Scotland over the last decade.
â€œThe cost of living crisis is disproportionately affecting poorer households and now, more than ever, it is important everyone is aware of the help that is available.
â€œSome people are also eligible for other council tax discounts or sometimes full exemptions, including students, people with disabilities and carers amongst others.
â€œI urge people to check their eligibility for council tax reduction and other financial support by visiting our online resources or by contacting their local council.â€
Background:
People can check whether they are eligible for Council Tax Reduction through mygov.scot or by contacting their local council.

Anyone who may be feeling anxious, stressed or low is being encouraged to seek support as soon as possible and not wait until the festive season is over. They are also being reminded that mental wellbeing support is available over the festive period for anyone who may be struggling over the coming days and weeks.
Mental Wellbeing Minister Kevin Stewart said:
â€œFor some, the festive season can be a tough time. People may be on their own with no family, they may have health issues, concerns about Covid or flu or other worries affecting them. This time of year can also be the trigger for existing family tensions or anniversaries of a life-changing event.
â€œThe rising cost of living is on everyoneâ€™s mind and many people are having to make difficult decisions about how they will pay for things. All this can have an impact on our mental health and wellbeing and lead to increased stress and anxiety.
â€œWith the challenging times weâ€™ve been through over the last few years, many are finding things particularly tough this year and it's normal to feel stressed or down.
â€œReaching out to others for help, whether thatâ€™s to friends and family or to services who can provide emotional support, is often the hardest step. There is help and support available throughout â€“ please donâ€™t wait until after the festive season to speak to somebody.â€

                        Landlords announce plans for average increases.
                    

Ministers have reached an agreement with social landlords on below-inflation rent increases for the next financial year.
Organisations representing social landlords have announced their membersâ€™ plans for average rent increases for 2023-24, which will keep rents significantly below private market levels.
Under the Cost of Living (Tenant Protection) Act 2022, rents are effectively frozen in the social rented sectors until 31 March 2023. Decisions onÂ future plans forÂ the private sector rent freeze, as well as other measures contained in the Act, will be announced in the coming weeks.
Tenantsâ€™ Rights Minister Patrick Harvie said:
â€œOur emergency legislation has given people â€“ whether they rent in the private or social rented sector â€“ reassurance within their current tenancies through the worst of the winter, even as their other costs have been rising.
â€œWe recognise the enormous pressures households are facing, and by making this announcement now we aim to give social tenants advance notice, and confidence that any rent increase will be well below inflation.
â€œThe statements of intent from the social rented sector, based on consultations with tenants, will keep rents affordable while allowing social landlords to continue investing in essential services such as home improvements and maintenance.""
Councillor Maureen Chalmers, COSLAâ€™s Community Wellbeing Spokesperson, said:
â€œThis is good news for Local Authority tenants from Scotlandâ€™s Council Leaders today.Â 
""In balancing the wide range of competing factors, Leaders with housing stock will seek to reach agreement with tenants over any increase in rents for the year 2023-24.Â Councilsâ€™ consultative arrangements would normally allow them, subject to approval of local governance structures, to raise rents annually to meet rising costs.
""During these difficult times, as providers of social housing and Gypsy/Traveller pitch or site provision, we intend to keep the rental and fee increases to an average of less than Â£5 a week across the country.â€
Sally Thomas, Chief Executive at the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations (SFHA), said:
â€œWe welcome the fact that Scottish Government has worked closely with the sector, to understand the evidence and avoid unintended consequences of this legislation, and to find a collaborative way forward. Investing in good quality, warm homes for social rent is crucial to tackling poverty in Scotland and protecting new and existing tenants from the increasing cost of living.â€
Background
COSLA and the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations (SFHA) have published statements setting out their membersâ€™ intentions for rent in 2023/24. COSLA has committed to keeping local authority rent increases to an average of no more than Â£5 a week. Members of the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations and Glasgow West of Scotland Forum of Housing Associations have reported planned increases averaging 6.1%.
TheÂ reference toÂ average figures, rather than a fixed cap, allows for the flexibility to honour the outcomes of the statutory tenant consultations that social landlords must undertake each year on rent setting.
No social landlord is consulting on a rent increase at or above CPI inflation, which was 11.1% at the time of the data being collected.            ",12/21/2022,Agreement on social rents for 2023-24

                        New strategyÂ to improve the lives of unpaid carers.
                    

A new National Carers Strategy will drive forward long-term changes to improve the lives of unpaid carers across Scotland.
It follows extensive engagement with carer organisations, carer centres, local government, and unpaid carers themselves. The strategy recognises the challenges of the cost crisis and COVID-19 recovery and supports long-term change that will allow carers to care for their loved ones in a way that balances all other aspects of their full and busy lives.
Recognising that unpaid carers come from all walks of life, the strategy also aims to ensure that their importance to society is recognised and that carers voices are represented and heard in national policy making.
Some of the actions in the strategy include:Â  Â 
working with employers to support flexible and inclusive workplaces for those with caring responsibilities
supporting unpaid carers to direct them to appropriate resources during the cost crisis
investing in local carer support and short breaks for carers and delivering a new right to breaks from caring
Social Care Minister Kevin Stewart said:
â€œWe want Scotland to be a place where all carers are valued for the contribution they make and can provide the right support for the people they care for while living full lives. No-one should need to put their life on hold because they provide care to a loved one.
â€œThe Strategy sets out how we will support unpaid carers to care for loved ones without the financial worries and social isolation. 1 in 8 of us cares for someone, and we should be able to do that without having to fight for support, recognition, and quality of life.
â€œIt provides a coherent picture of what the Scottish Government is doing to build a sustainable future for unpaid carers. This includes the development of longer-term options for improvement to Scottish Carerâ€™s Assistance and on-going work to consider a Minimum Income Guarantee.â€
Martyn Sloan, unpaid carer representative, Dundee IJB said:
â€œI welcome this latest strategy from the Scottish Government, their willingness to continue to engage with carers on all matters that are affecting them and the ongoing funding through the Carers Act shows that the government of Scotland values unpaid carers. The strategy document puts that commitment down in black and white.â€
Don Williamson, Chief Executive, Shared Care Scotland on behalf of Scotlandâ€™s national carer organisations said:
â€œThe strategy helpfully sets out government action across a range of policy areas that will, we hope, ensure its resources for carers are directed to where they will be most effective. We must now work together to ensure it delivers for carers and protects their health and wellbeing as we face up to the challenges ahead.â€

                        Budget sets out Â£4.85 billion investment in Education and Skills.
                    

A range of measures to help children, parents and carers with costs around school have been set out in the Scottish Government's budget. These include expansion of free school meals in primary schools, holiday food provision and investment to ensure the school clothing grant national minimum of Â£120 for primary pupils and Â£150 for secondary pupils.
The spending plans for 2023-24 allocates Â£4.85 billion of funding across the education and skills portfolio, including measures to address the cost of living crisis.
New investment will see free school meals expanded to primary six and seven pupils in receipt of the Scottish Child Payment â€“ the next step in Scottish Government plans to deliver universal free school meals in primary schools.
It also includes Â£22 million of continued support to provide meals during the school holidays to children who need them most, along with Â£200 million for the Scottish Attainment Challenge.
In addition, the budget allocates Â£50 million of funding to continue to support the Whole Family Wellbeing programme of activity, a key pillar of The Promise, to support families to thrive.
Education Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said:
""I am committed to improving the life chances of all Scotlandâ€™s children, young people and learners. The measures set out in these spending plansÂ are driven by our ambition to enable everybody to reach their full potential.
""We know the toll that the cost of living crisis has taken on families and households across Scotland and investment is being made in a range of important measures which will help mitigate the impact of this.
""The expansion of free school meals in primary schools continues, providing a benefit in kind of around Â£400 per child for families, while the ongoing investment in the school clothing grant and access to digital devices will help those who need it most.
""Our ongoing commitment to free university tuition means that, unlike elsewhere in the UK, Scottish domiciled students do not incur additional debt of up to Â£27,750, and average student loan debt in Scotland remains the lowest in the UK.
â€œIn Scotland we also have the most teachers-per-pupil, along with the highest per-pupil education spend anywhere in the UK. We will continue to provide local authorities with funding of Â£145.5 million per year to support the teaching workforce, as part of the overall local government settlement of Â£13.2 billion.
""Our commitment to closing the poverty related-attainment gap remains paramount and that is why we will invest a further Â£200 million next year in the Scottish Attainment Challenge â€“ as part of our Â£1 billion commitment in this Parliament.â€
The measures set out in the budget to help reduce the cost of school include:
Providing more than Â£13 million to uprate the School Clothing Grant in line with inflation.
Investing an additional Â£16 million resource and Â£80 million capital to fund the expansion of Free School Meals for all Primary 6 and 7 pupils in receipt of the Scottish Child Payment, as the next step in fulfilling the commitment to universal provision in primary schools
Continuing to invest Â£22 million to provide meals during school holidays to the children who need them most.
Maintaining subsidy arrangements for the provision of milk and working with partners on a phased approach to the delivery of a universal milk scheme, aligned to the expansion of free school meals.
Investing Â£20 million towards the commitment to ensure every school-aged child, over the lifetime of the parliament, has access to a digitalÂ device to support their learning
Investment of nearly Â£2 billion towards Scotlandâ€™s universities and colleges to support delivery of high-quality education and training. This includes a cash increase of Â£20 million in the Higher Education resource budget compared to 2022-23, and a cash increase of Â£33.7 million in the Further Education resource and capital budget.

A total of Â£964 million has been allocated to the Rural Affairs and Islands portfolio in the Scottish budget.
More than Â£620 million will provide ongoing agricultural support ensuring stability to farmers, crofters and land managers in 2023-24.
It comes as the first tranche of the Less Favoured Area Support Scheme payments are set to arrive in bank accounts ahead of schedule before Christmas.
The National Test Programme, which is helping farmers and crofters achieve statutory emissions targets, will see year two funded with Â£20 million.
Less Favoured Area Support Scheme payments are being made a month ahead of previous years and total Â£55.8 million.
Rural Affairs Secretary Mairi Gougeon said: â€œOur farmers and crofters are vital to Scotlandâ€™s economy and the Scottish Budget 2023-24 reflects that.
â€œDespite the difficult financial circumstances we, like governments all over the world, are faced with, the Scottish Government has sought to protect financial support for our farmers - to provide cash flow certainty amid these extremely challenging times.
â€œIn addition, Â£405.5 Â million of Basic Payment Scheme and Greening payments have already been made to 17,001 farmers and crofters.â€
â€œWithin the latest budget, those working the land in the most remote and fragile areas will continue to receive support through the Less Favoured Areas Scheme, which has been allocated Â£65 million.â€
â€œOur ambition to make Scotland a global leader in sustainable and regenerative agriculture is underlined by Â£44 million of funding.â€

                        Â£20 million referendum funding will support people struggling with their energy bills.
                    

Thousands of vulnerable households will be supported by the continuation of the Scottish Governmentâ€™s uprated Â£20 million Fuel Insecurity Fund.
Announced as part of last weekâ€™s Scottish Budget 2023-24, the investment will enable third sector partners to continue to provide support to households who are at risk of self-disconnection or self-rationing their energy use. While the Scottish Government remains committed toÂ engaging with the UK Government to deliver a referendum on Scottish Independence, funding that was originally earmarked for a referendum in 2023 will now be used to help tackle fuel poverty.
Last weekâ€™s Scottish Budget included additional steps to address inequality while tackling the climate emergency including increased investment of over Â£366 million next year to support the delivery of the Heat in Buildings Strategy. It forms part of a package of measures introduced by the Scottish Government to protect the most vulnerable households from the impact of the current cost of living crisis.
The decisions taken through the Emergency Budget Review in November enabled the Scottish Government to provide additional immediate support to people most impacted by the cost of living crisis, specifically rising energy prices, by doubling the Fuel Insecurity Fund to Â£20 million this year. The Scottish Budget is now protecting that investment into 2023-24.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Minister for Zero Carbon Buildings Patrick Harvie met with people on the frontline of tackling fuel poverty, while visiting the Wise Group in Glasgow, a social enterprise working to lift people out of poverty by providing mentoring support to help with employment and life skills and offering energy advice.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:
â€œPeople across our country are paying a steep price for the economic mismanagement of the UK Government, with the cost of living forcing many to choose between heating their home or eating â€“ the Fuel Insecurity Fund aims to stop that happening.
â€œThe Scottish Government has, and always will, use its currently limited powers to the maximum extent in order to meet the challenges being faced by the people of Scotland right now. Powers relating to energy markets are reserved to the UK Government, so I am renewing my call for further and more urgent action, to support the most vulnerable households.
â€œWith this intervention â€“ as with many others the Scottish Government has set out â€“ we are having to divert funding into policies that aim to minimise the impact on people as a direct result of UK Government policy.
â€œThe full powers of independence would enable us to make different choices and help people facing the devastating consequences of the cost of living crisis.â€
Minister for Zero Carbon Buildings and Tenants' Rights Patrick Harvie said:
â€œEveryone needs a safe, warm and affordable place to call home and yet despite this we know that many people are struggling under the weight of their energy bills and wider cost of living pressures. Last week, the Scottish Budget confirmed Â£366m for insulating homes and buildings and tackling fuel poverty as part of our Â£1.8 billion commitment to Heat in Buildings over this Parliament.
â€œThat is essential work to make sure that Scotland has warmer homes which are cheaper to heat for decades ahead. Â We also need the full range of powers on matters like energy pricing, consumer protection and energy supply to make the biggest possible difference. But right now, the Fuel Insecurity Fund is a lifeline to many people struggling most with fuel poverty which is why we have made the commitment for next year.â€
Background
The Scottish Governmentâ€™s Fuel Insecurity Fund includes provision for households on any tariff type and using any type of fuel.
The Wise Group play a significant role in enabling the success of energy crisis funding across the UK to support the tackling of fuel poverty. By March 2023, the Wise Group will have successfully distributed over Â£3 million of energy crisis funding directly to households and vulnerable energy customers since March 2020.
It is vital that those worried about, or struggling with, heating their homes access the information and support they need to reduce their energy bills. We have recently provided Â£1.2 million of extra funding to key agencies, including Advice Direct Scotland, Home Energy Scotland and Citizens Advice Scotland, to help those struggling to pay their bills and heat their homes. Those struggling with their energy bills should also speak to their provider to discuss options that might help mitigate or manage rising bills.

Almost Â£3.4 billion will be invested across the justice system in 2023-24 to fund vital front-line services, provide continued support for victims and witnesses, and to tackle the causes of offending.
Underlining the Scottish Budgetâ€™s priority to support sustainable public services despite the cost-of-living crisis, the funding represents an increase of Â£165 million or a 5.8% increase on this yearâ€™s justice resource budget.
Recognising the crucial role Police Scotland officers and staff play keeping our communities safe, the service will receive substantial additional resource funding of Â£80 million in the next financial year, a 6.3% increase. Police capital funding has been maintained at Â£45.5 million for investment in assets including the estate, fleet and technology. This brings the policing budget to Â£1.45 billion for 2023-24.
Equal access to justice for all is a key priority for the Scottish Government, withÂ an additionalÂ Â£3 million allocated in the budget to safeguard Legal Aid, andÂ Â£3 million to strengthen access to Justice, to benefit deprived communities and vulnerable groups.
Funding of more than Â£42 million will be maintained to continue to reduce the backlog of court cases built up during the COVID-19 period and for community justice services, including alternatives to remand. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service will receive a Â£10 million increase to support service delivery and the Scottish Prison Service gets an additional Â£29 million to support a modern and safe prison system.
Justice Secretary Keith Brown said:
â€œThis Budget will support vital front-line services, provide support for victims and witnesses, and allow us to tackle the underlying drivers of offending.
â€œOur investment in policing has helped deliver historically low recorded crime rates, we have more police officers per head of population than England and Wales and new officers here start on significantly higher salaries that those in the rest of the UK.
Â â€œThe further increase of Â£80 million to police budgets next year builds on this solid track record to keep our communities safe.
â€œIn this difficult financial landscape it is prudent we bring absolute focus to our key priorities which is why this Budget also continues essential funding to provide emotional and practical support for victims, while safeguarding Legal Aid and equal access to justice both now and into the future.
â€œAcross the whole justice sector, this Budget will support delivery of our transformative reforms in a low crime environment where people feel safe.â€
Background
The Justice Budget is part of a wider package of financial support presented to the Scottish Parliament on Thursday, 15 December by Deputy First Minister John Swinney.
The extra investment in Justice also includes:
An additional Â£80 million resource for the Scottish Police Authority, which provides safety and security for communities across Scotland.
Police core capital funding has been maintained at Â£45.5 million for investment in the police asset base including its greening the fleet programme.
Additional revenue spending of Â£29 million in the Scottish prison Service and continuing investment in the modernisation of the prison estate, with Â£97 million in capital funding provided.
Total investment of Â£134 million in community justice services, which includes the continuation of an additional investment of Â£15 million from 2022-23 to support recovery efforts, bolster capacity, and strengthen alternatives to remand by improving and increasing the use of bail services.Â 
The Scottish Government will provide an additional Â£5 million resource and Â£4.7 million capital for the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service. This will help to meet pay and inflation pressures, and to support essential capital repair and replacement works.
Â£4.2 million is being invested in Legal Aid, alongside Â£3 million to strengthen access to justice, including in deprived communities and for vulnerable groups.
Â£3.5 million is being invested this year in the continued delivery of the Digital Evidence Sharing Capability programme which will allow evidence to be shared digitally from crime scene to court room, significantly improving efficiency in the investigation and prosecution of crime.
Continuation of the Â£48 million over 3-year funding support for victimsâ€™ organisations across Scotland, through the Victim Centred Approach Fund.

Health and Social Care services will receive the highest ever budget settlement over the next year, paving the way for sustainable public services in Scotland.
The Â£19 billion package will help tackle the immediate pressures caused by the pandemic and a tough winter, while supporting the delivery of health and care services that are fit for the future.
The Scottish Government has surpassed its commitment to ensure every extra penny it receives from the UK Government is spent on health and social care. This means an extra Â£1 billion will be available to improve front line services and help fund the NHS pay deal for 2022/23.
Health Boards across Scotland will receive a 6% boost in funding as part of the Budget â€“ bringing their total budget to Â£13.7 billion, which includes over Â£9 billion to give staff a fair wage.
Social care and integration will also benefit from Â£1.7 billion in funding over the next year. This will help deliver vital reforms of social care, continue work towards creating the countryâ€™s first National Care Service, and improving conditions for care workers â€“ by funding a Â£10.90 Real Living Wage for adult social care workers in commissioned services.
This Budget continues to support prevention and early intervention, as well as the provision of quality community care, providing:
More than Â£1.2 billion for mental health services to provide record staff numbers that provide more varied support and services to more people than ever.
Over Â£2 billion to deliver and improve primary health care services in the community, enabling dental reform and supporting crucial GP services through investment in multi-disciplinary teams and targeted assistance to support system
Â£160 million to address the public health emergencies and reduce the avoidable harms associated with drugs and alcohol.
Fully restoring the budget for life-saving procedures such as thrombectomies â€“ which remove blood clots â€“ despite the need to make a short term reduction to tackle the inflationary pressures faced by the whole UK.
Health Secretary, Humza Yousaf, said:
â€œFrontline workers are the foundation of our health and care services and I am extremely grateful for them for getting us through the pandemic and facing-down one of the toughest winters in NHS history.
â€œThis historic settlement took some difficult decisions, but we are steadfast in efforts to address the immediate pressures on health and social care services, and support fair work and pay.
â€œI want health and care services that are fit for the future â€“ a future where Scotland continues to be the best place for health and care workers and where everyone gets the care that they need, where and when they need it.â€
John Watson, Associate Director of the Stroke Association in Scotland said:
â€œThe stroke community in Scotland was united in alarm over recent cuts to the thrombectomy programme and we therefore welcome this renewed funding of a life-saving, and cost-saving service. The Cabinet Secretary has now given us his assurance that the commitment to a national round-the-clock thrombectomy service remains.
â€œWe look forward to continuing this positive discussion, with the aim of a clear timetable for delivering one of the most effective and cost-saving procedures available to us.â€
Chest Heart and Stroke Scotland Chief Executive Jane-Claire Judson said:
â€œWe welcome that the Scottish Government has listened to stroke survivors, charities and health professionals and restored funding for developing a national thrombectomy service. This cost-effective and life-changing procedure can make a huge difference to stroke survivors ensuring many more are able to walk again, talk again and live their lives to the full.
â€œWe now need to see work on setting up a 24/7 national service restart as a matter of urgency and a timetable for delivery so that every stroke patient who needs it gets the best chance of living life to the full.â€Â Â             ",12/16/2022,Record Â£19 billion for Health and Social Care

                        Strengthening the social contract with Scotlandâ€™s people.
                    

Â 
Deputy First Minister John Swinney laid out â€œa different, more progressive path for Scotlandâ€ as he presented the Scottish Budget 2023-24.
He promised to strengthen the social contract with the people of Scotland and pledged to do everything possible to shield families from the welfare cuts and austerity policies of the UK Government.
Supporting sustainable public services through the cost of living crisis is a priority â€“ including more than Â£13.7 billion for NHS boards and Â£2 billion to establish and improve primary healthcare services in communities, as well as Â£1.7 billion for social care and integration, paving the way for the National Care Service. This record investment goes well beyond any previous commitment to pass on all consequentials to health and social care, and delivers a Â£1 billion uplift to the health budget.
Having already increased the unique Scottish Child Payment to Â£25 per week as part of a drive to eradicate child poverty, the Budget invests Â£428 million to uprate all other devolved benefits in April 2023 by Septemberâ€™s Consumer Price Index inflation level of 10.1%. It commits Â£20 million to extend the Fuel Insecurity Fund to provide a lifeline for households, including the most vulnerable, against rising energy prices.
Scotlandâ€™s transition to net zero is boosted with increased investment to over Â£366 million in delivering the Heat in Buildings Strategy in 2023-24. This will help tackle fuel poverty as part of a Â£1.8 billion commitment over this Parliament to improve energy efficiency and decarbonise more than a million Scottish homes by 2030.
The Budget commits Â£50 million to the Just Transition Fund for the North East and Moray - more than double the 2022-23 allocation - to diversify the regional economy away from carbon-intensive industries and capitalise on the opportunities presented by new, green industries.
Strengthened by the agreement between the Scottish Government and the Scottish Green Party, the 2023-24 Scottish Budget also includes:
around Â£1 billion investment in high quality early learning and childcare provision, with a further Â£22 million invested in holiday food provision and expanding support for school-age childcare
Â£50 million for the Whole Family Wellbeing programme for preventative co-ordinated family support and a further Â£30 million to keep The Promise to care experienced children and young people
Â£80 million capital funding to support the expansion of free school meals
going beyond existing commitments with more than Â£550 million additional funding to Local Government
Â£165 million additional funding for frontline justice services and to continue with transformational reforms
a Â£46 million increase in resource funding to universities and colleges to ensure a highly qualified and highly skilled workforce for Scotland
Mr Swinney said:
â€œThe Scottish Government, like governments all over the world, is faced with a difficult set of choices. Through this Budget we are facing up to our responsibilities while being honest with the people of Scotland about the challenges which lie ahead.
â€œTo govern is to choose and the Scottish Government has made its choice.
â€œWithin the powers available to us, we will choose a different path. A path which sees the Scottish Government commit substantial resources to protect the most vulnerable people of Scotland from the impact of decisions and policies made by the UK Government. We choose to stand firmly behind the Scottish people, investing in our public services and doing everything possible to ensure that no one is left behind.
â€œThis Budget strengthens the social contract between the Scottish Government and every citizen of Scotland for the wider benefit of society. This social contract means that people in Scotland continue to enjoy many benefits not available throughout the UK â€“ including free prescriptions, free access to higher education and the Scottish Child Payment.Â 
â€œBecause we know this progressive model works, we choose the path where people are asked to pay their fair share, in the knowledge that in so doing they help to create the fairer society in which we all want to live.â€

The 2023-24 Scottish Budget will take a distinctive approach to creating a fairer, more equal Scotland, Deputy First Minister John Swinney said.
He stressed the three Budget priorities of eradicating child poverty, strengthening public services and moving towards a net zero economy were strongly linked and would give more people the opportunity to flourish.
Ahead of delivering the Budget to Parliament today, Mr Swinney visited a scheme, delivered by City of Edinburgh Council and part-funded by the Scottish Government, installing insulation for households at risk of fuel poverty.
He said:
â€œI was encouraged to see the vital work being carried out to improve energy efficiency and make homes warmer for families facing significantly higher bills this winter. This scheme highlights how tackling the increased cost of living can assist our drive towards net zero, and is an example of the importance of effective public services.
â€œOur Budget goals are mutually beneficial and represent a distinctive approach to the economic challenges we face. The Scottish Budget will take further steps to address inequality and eradicate child poverty. It will encourage a just transition to net zero, creating wealth and opportunity across the country. And it will be the catalyst for reforms necessary to ensure our first-class public services remain sustainable in the face of the challenges to come.
â€œI would like to go even further but the cost of living crisis has also laid bare the fiscal constraints of devolution, as we cannot borrow to support day to day expenditure when times are hard to assist us through these difficult days. It is clear that businesses and households are paying a steep price for the economic mismanagement of the UK Government.
â€œThe cost of living crisis requires decisive action. In setting this Budget, the Scottish Government will use its limited powers to the maximum extent that is responsible, to meet the challenges faced by the people of Scotland.â€
Background
Â The Scottish Budget 2023-24 will be presented to the Scottish Parliament on Thursday 15 December.
The Scottish Government has provided more than Â£550 million since 2013 to councils across Scotland to provide insulation in hard-to-treat homes, helping 104,000 fuel poor households make their homes warmer and more energy efficient.
Wester Hailes is part of the Area Based Scheme delivered by City of Edinburgh council and targets households in fuel poverty/mixed tenure flats, delivering insulation and essential repairs.            ",12/15/2022,A Budget for a fair Scotland

                        Primary school literacy and numeracy improvement reaches new high.
                    

The poverty-related attainment gaps in literacy and numeracy levels across primary schools have seen the biggest decreases since records began, official statistics show.
The gap between the proportion of primary pupils from the most and least-deprived areas achieving expected levels has narrowed by 3.4 percentage points in literacy and 3.7 percentage points in numeracy, according to the Achievement of Curriculum for Excellence Levels (ACEL) 2021/22. This marks the largest narrowing of the gap in a year since consistent records began in 2016/17.
There has also been a record increase in the proportion of primary school pupils achieving the expected levels of literacy (up 3.7 percentage points to 70.5%) and numeracy (up 3.3 percentage points to 77.9%).
Education Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said:
â€œThese figures demonstrate a real recovery from the pandemic and underline our progress towards tackling the poverty-related attainment gap, and achieving excellence for all of Scotlandâ€™s children and young people.
â€œThis record improvement over one year for primary pupils achieving the expected levels in numeracy and literacy also shows more young people are getting the support they need to reach their full potential.
â€œHowever, there is no room for complacency. I recognise that attainment levels are still largely below pre-pandemic levels and the publication of local stretch aims by local councils last week sets out clear plans to significantly narrow the poverty-related attainment gap in the years ahead.
â€œWe know that the impact of the pandemic â€“ compounded by the current cost of living crisis â€“ means children and young people need our support now more than ever. We are determined to do all we can to ensure they can reach their full potential, including a record investment of Â£1billion over this parliamentary term in the Scottish Attainment Challenge.â€
Background
The Achievement of Curriculum for Excellence Levels (ACEL) 2021/22 statisticsÂ  include data at Scotland level and for each local authority.
Data was collected and published for primary school pupils only in 2020/21 with the secondary school and special schoolÂ  collection cancelled due to the additional work pressures on teachers resulting from the Alternative Certification Model.
Therefore, for S3 pupils comparisons cannot be made to 2020/21 as the data was not collected for that year. Attainment at this level has been close to 90 per cent for both literacy and numeracy since 2016/17. In 2021/22, 86% of S3 pupils achieved this level in literacy, with 89 per cent in numeracy.
In 2021/22, the full collection went ahead for the first time since 2018/19 meaning that data is being published for P1, P4, P7, S3 and special schools.            ",12/13/2022,Record narrowing of the attainment gap

                        Helping families and services through the cost of living crisis.
                    

Eradicating child poverty, transforming the economy to deliver net zero and creating sustainable public services will be the key aims of the Scottish Budget 2023-24.
Deputy First Minister John Swinney warned relentless prioritisation was needed to tackle the combined impact of high inflation, the ongoing economic consequences of Brexit and the UK Governmentâ€™s plans to reduce expenditure in future years, which are projected to reduce the Scottish Governmentâ€™s funding under the Barnett formula from 2025.
He said the Budget would channel support to where it was most needed while beginning a process of reform to help public services face the future with strength and resilience.
Mr Swinney said:
â€œFamilies, businesses and our public finances are under sustained economic pressure and the Scottish Government has acted decisively to provide what support it can within its limited resources. We have allocated Â£3 billion in 2022-23 to mitigate the impact of the cost of living crisis, including targeted help such as increasing the game changing Scottish Child Payment to Â£25 per eligible child per week â€“ a 150% increase within eight months.Â 
â€œHowever, given the fiscal constraints of devolution, it is not possible to go as far as we would like and so the Budget will prioritise three areas â€“ eradicating child poverty, transforming the economy to deliver net zero and creating sustainable public services.
""Difficult decisions are required and resources will be targeted where they are most needed and can secure maximum value from every pound spent.
â€œThe economic challenges we face also require a fundamental change in the way we manage public spending. The Bank of England is predicting the longest recession for a century so this Budget will set in motion reforms that will place our finances and public services on a more sustainable and resilient footing for the future.
â€œThis is a time for firm leadership and bold decision making. Steps we take now will help ensure Scotland emerges from the current crisis a stronger, fairer, greener country.â€

                        Â£1.4 million Cost Crisis Emergency Fund launched.
                    

Islanders most impacted by the cost of living crisis will be able to access additional help.
The Islands Cost Crisis Emergency Fund will target immediate support to those who are struggling due to the cost of living crisis, either through existing schemes or new support.
The Fund was identified as part of the Emergency Budget Review announced last month as the cost of living on islands is higher when compared to the mainland. Funding is being allocated directly to the six island local authorities to support the needs of their communities.
Rural Affairs Secretary Mairi Gougeon said:
â€œIslands already experience higher costs of living, with some estimates around 20-65 per cent higher than the UK average, with higher fuel costs, a colder climate and the lack of consumer choice intensifying the impact of the cost crisis on islanders.
â€œThis fund was developed to enable Local Authorities to take urgent action in helping mitigate the impacts of the cost of living crisis on households. Â 
â€œI would like to thank everyone involved for their commitment in getting this fund rolled out as quickly as possible and I hope it can provide support to those who need it the most.â€
Sheila McKandie Head of Revenues & Customer Services at the Highland Council said:
â€œHighland Council very much welcome the Island Cost Crisis Emergency Fund award.
â€œThis will supplement existing funds and help in providing further support to our island communities.â€
James Stockan Council Leader at Orkney Islands Council said:
â€œAs we head into winter, households right across our community are facing rising bills, increasing costs, and tough choices. This financial support from the Scottish Government is a welcome boost as we face these challenges.Â 
â€œOur share of the fund is Â£305,000, of which Â£65,000 must be capital spend â€“ elected members and officials will now be taking the time to determine how best we spend all of this fund to provide the optimum benefit for our community.â€

                        More help for victims as criminals pay towards costs.
                    

The third application round of the Victim Surcharge Fund has now opened for bids from organisations that support victims of crime.
Anyone who commits a crime that results in a court fine isÂ charged an additional penalty â€“ the victim surcharge. The accumulated Victim Surcharge Fund provides direct, practical help to victims, for example meeting household repair costs that have arisen due to crime, or providing food, utility or clothing expenses for people escaping domestic abuse.
A total of Â£413,727 has been awarded to organisations, including Victim Support Scotland, trauma and loss centre the Manda Centre and Scottish womenâ€™s aid groups, since the Scottish Government launched the Victim Surcharge Fund in 2019.
Justice Secretary Keith Brown said:
â€œWe are committed to putting victims' rights and needs at the centre of the criminal justice system and it is absolutely right that criminals should pay towards helping victims of crime as they recover from their experience.
â€œThe Victim Surcharge Fund builds on the Scottish Governmentâ€™s wider support for victims. Over the past five years we have invested Â£93m through our justice budget alone, demonstrating our commitment to putting victims first.
â€œI encourage victim support organisations to apply to the Fund so that victims can continue to access the support and help that they need.â€
Chief Executive of Victim Support Scotland Kate Wallace said:
â€œThe cost-of-living crisis has meant that more people affected by crime are struggling to make ends meet.Â This additional funding from the Victim Surcharge Fund allows VSS to cover the cost of essential items such as food vouchers, property repairs, alarms and funeral costs, thereby meeting the needs of vulnerable victims in the aftermath of crime.
â€œSince 2020, VSS Emergency Assistance Fund has provided Â£495,000 worth of goods to more than 1,000 people and their families, thanks to funding from the Victim Surcharge Fund. We accept applications directly from people affected by crime and have received referrals from over 200 support organisations.
â€œFor many of the people we support, this financial assistance is simply life changing. We welcome the news that the fund has reopened, which helps empower people to move on after a crime.â€
Background 
Victims' organisations interested in applying to the Fund can request an application form by emailing VictimSurchargefund@gov.scot and should apply by the 9 January 2023 deadline.
Previous recipients have included Victim Support Scotland, The Moira Fund, The Manda Centre, Angus Womenâ€™s Aid and Dumbarton District Womenâ€™s Aid.
The victim surcharge came into force in Scotland on 25 November 2019 and applies to all persons who commit an offence on or after that date and who are subsequently convicted and receive a court fine.

Scotlandâ€™s attractiveness to global investors will be enhanced by the establishment of the First Ministerâ€™s Investor Panel.
The expert panel of investors and asset managers will advise on how Scotland can create the right conditions to attract global capital investment to develop the physical infrastructure required for a just transition. Its remit includes areas such as offshore wind, hydrogen and the decarbonisation of transport.
Members have been selected for their experience and expertise, bringing together a wealth of knowledge to provide market intelligence in current and future green investment opportunities.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Angus MacPherson, CEO at Noble & Company, will co-chair the Panel, which will meet for the first time on 12 December.Â 
Speaking at TheCityUK Annual Conference in Edinburgh, the First Minister said:
â€œSecuring capital investment from sources within Scotland, across the UK, and right around the world is fundamental to enabling us to achieve our wider ambitions for the economy. Tackling the climate crisis is both a moral obligation and an economic opportunity. We have the chance to establish Scotland as a major centre for green and ethical finance, while helping Scotland - and perhaps also the wider world - to move to net zero.
â€œThe investor panel demonstrates the Scottish Governmentâ€™s determination to work with the investor community. We know how crucial it is to support sustainable growth and we want to use insights and expertise from the sector as we recover from the pandemic, get through the cost of living crisis, and ensure a just and rapid transition to net zero.""
Angus MacPherson, co-chair of the Panel, said:
â€œI am delighted to accept the First Ministerâ€™s invitation to Co-chair the Investor Panel.
â€œThere is a clear and compelling case for the private and public sectors to work together to address the global challenges we face, particularly on the need to transition to net zero.
â€œI look forward to working with the First Minister and panel members to explore how we can attract mobile capital investment, maximise current and future growth opportunities and help deliver a just transition to net zero.â€
Miles Celic, Chief Executive Officer at TheCityUK, said:
â€œScotlandâ€™s financial and related professional services industry has always had innovation at its core. It has long played an important role in driving growth and opportunity here at home and around the world. To build on this success and unlock the investment needed to fund critical projects for a Net-Zero future in Scotland and beyond, a close partnership between government, industry and regulators is essential.â€
Background
The Scottish Government committed in Scotland's National Strategy for Economic Transformation - gov.scot (www.gov.scot) to establishing an Investor Panel to attract investment for a pipeline of projects in Scotland that support the transition to net zero and that brings investor intelligence to policy and regulatory development early in the process.
The full membership of the Investor Panel will be confirmed in due course; members include:

People who receive Scottish Child Payment and qualify for Best Start Grant Early Learning and School Age payments will be paid them automatically from this week, without the need to apply for them separately.Â 
Social Security Scotland will notify clients by SMS when they are checking eligibility for the Best Start Grants and, if they are eligible, will write to advise them of the payment.
The move to automatic awards will mean less paperwork for tens of thousands of families and ensure that families automatically receive the support to which theyâ€™re entitled.
It builds on work already completed to make applying for our five family payments as simple as possible.
It includes the ability to apply for all children in a household on a single form.
Minister for Social Security, Ben Macpherson said:
""Our extension to the Scottish Child Payment and its increase to Â£25 per child per week has been widely welcomed and will make a significant difference to families across the country. The increase represents a rise of 150% in just eight months.
â€œThe increase and extension was described as a watershed moment in tackling child poverty by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and already people have applied in their tens of thousands.
â€œTackling child poverty is a key mission for the Scottish Government and automating payments, where we have the information we need to do so, will mean parents and carers automatically getting the financial support they are eligible for paid directly to them.
â€œWe are committed to making sure that receiving our five family payments is as straightforward as possible, using our limited social security powers and resources to helpâ€.
CEO of One Parent Families Scotland, Satwat Rehman said
â€œWe are delighted that Social Security Scotland have made changes so that parents who have applied for and receive Scottish Child Payment will no longer have to fill out separate forms to receive other family benefits.
â€œMany of the single parents we support are not aware of the financial support available to them and would therefore be at risk of losing out. We hope the change to automatic payments will lead to an increase in the number of families accessing benefits they are entitled to and will ease the financial and mental strain of the cost-of-living crisis.â€
Background
Best Start Grant Early Learning Payment and Best Start Grant School Age Payment are part of a package of five family payments. This package also includes Best Start Grant Pregnancy and Baby Payment, Best Start Foods and Scottish Child Payment. The Scottish Governmentâ€™s package of five family payments for low-income families is worth up to a maximum of over Â£10,000 by the time a familyâ€™s first child turns 6, and Â£9,700 for second and subsequent children
Best Start Grant Early Learning Payment provides Â£267.65 per child to support child development, for example travel costs, trips out and toys for home learning
The School Age Payment provides Â£267.65 per child to help with the costs of preparing for school, for example educational toys or after school activities. Eligibility is based on the childâ€™s age and relates to when a child is first old enough to start school. The application window runs from 1 June until the last day in February the following year. There is no requirement to take up a place at school to qualify for a payment
In 2022-23 we expect 59,000 households will receive Â£20 million of support through Best Start Grant (Scottish Fiscal Commission report published May 2022). With projected take up rates of 76% for Pregnancy and Baby first births, 77% for Pregnancy and Baby subsequent births, 90% for Early Learning Payment and 90% for School Age Payment
The Scottish Fiscal Commission (report published May 2022) has forecast that 30,000 people will receive the Early Learning Payment and 22,000 people will receive the School Age Payment during the 2022-23 financial year

                        Reported figures just â€˜tip of the icebergâ€™.
                    

Cabinet Secretary for Justice and Veterans Keith Brown is encouraging people experiencing domestic abuse to seek help, advice or support â€“ and where appropriate, report incidents to the police.
Official statistics for 2021-22 released today, show a 1% fall in the number of domestic abuse incidents recorded by the police. Of these, just over four-in-five had a female victim and a male suspected perpetrator.
It is the first time since the ground-breaking Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act,Â which criminalised psychological domestic abuse and coercive and controlling behaviour and came into effect in 2019 - that the number of reported incidents has fallen.
However, the most recent results from the Scottish Crime and Justice Survey (for 2018-20) estimated that fewer than one-in-five cases of domestic abuse are reported to the police.
Since the launch of the 2018 Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act, Scottish Government has introduced a range of measures to create a victim-centred justice system which helps people feel more confident in reporting crimes. This includes:
Establishing a Domestic Homicide Review taskforce to help prevent homicides in Scotland where domestic abuse is suspected
Providing Â£26.5m of funding to courts in 2021-22 to maintain enhancedÂ court capacity, helping to address backlogs
Introducing new Evidence by Commission suites â€“ to improve the experience of vulnerable victims when providing evidence for court cases.
Awarding Â£48m of funding to 23 organisations in Scotland over the next three years, through its Victim-Centred Approach Fund, including Â£18.5m for specialist advocacy support for survivors of gender-based violence.
The 2022-23 Programme for Government also commits to a consultation on new justice powers to tackle misogynistic behaviour, helping to address the root causes of inequalities and menâ€™s violence against women. The Scottish Government is also considering the possibility of a specialist sexual offences court to help improve victimsâ€™ experience of the justice system.
Mr Brown said: â€œI am grateful to everyone who has felt able to come forward over the past year to report incidents of domestic abuse to the police. Behind each of these numbers is a story in itself, of months or even years of abuse and control, which is why the Scottish Government legislated to give police, prosecutors and the courts greater powers to tackle such crimes.
â€œWhile the small drop in the number of domestic abuse incidents reported to the police may be welcome, the reality has always been that figures drawn from police reports represent only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the true extent of violence against women and girls.
â€œMy message to anyone experiencing violence, including coercive and controlling behaviours, is to seek help, advice or support â€“ and where appropriate, report incidents to the police.
â€œWe are continuing to make changes to the justice system to make it easier for people to come forward and report incidents and for perpetrators to be appropriately dealt with â€“ to help realise our vision of a Scotland as a place where women and girls live free of violence and abuse.â€
Assistant Chief Constable Bex Smith, Police Scotland said: â€œDomestic abuse remains an under-reported crime. Abusers manipulate and control their victims, and it can be difficult for victims to recognise whatâ€™s happening and then to seek help.
â€œFriends, families and colleagues can often be the first to recognise abuse and to call it out. I would urge anyone who is a victim of abuse or is concerned someone they know is a victim, then please get in touch. Help and support is available from the police and from support agencies.
â€œAll it takes is one call or one person to alert us and we can help end the threat and harm caused by domestic abuse.â€
Victim Support Scotland chief executive, Kate Wallace, said:
â€œVictim Support Scotland (VSS) is here to support people when they need it most. Looking beyond the statistics, our teams witness the devastating impact gender-based violence has on peoplesâ€™ lives.
â€œWe all have a collective duty to unite and respond to peopleâ€™s needs and do what we can to tackle gender-based violence. In response, our staff and volunteers continue to provide practical advice, emotional support as well as financial support through our Emergency Assistance Fund.
â€œVSS has also recently introduced remote evidence rooms where victims can pre-record or give evidence via video link to anywhere in the world, in a safe, supported and comfortable environment.Â 
â€œAnyone who is experiencing domestic abuse can access support through our helpline on 0800 160 1985 or through online chat by going to victimsupport.scot.â€
Scottish Womenâ€™s Aid chief executive Marsha Scott said: Â 
â€˜â€™There are many complex and legitimate reasons why women experiencing domestic abuse decide not to report their abuse to the police. At Scottish Womenâ€™s Aid, we offer practical and emotional support to all victim-survivors of domestic abuse - whatever they decide to doâ€”after all, they are the experts.Â  Throughout the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence, Scottish Womenâ€™s Aidâ€™s â€˜Cost of Leavingâ€™ campaign will highlight the impact that the cost of living crisis is having on women and children experiencing domestic abuse.
â€œLike Covid, children and womenâ€™s experience of poverty is the crisis within a crisis.Â  Fear of destitution and homelessness, mountains of debt, and threats from their abusers to child maintenance and other pressures make already constrained choices a set of worse-case scenarios.Â 
â€œThe domestic abuse statistics hardly begin to describe the abuse and fear that are made worse by the cost of living crisis. Scotland must put an appropriate financial safety net in place so that children and women seeking safety and freedom donâ€™t face these draconian choices.â€

                        An Official Statistics Publication for Scotland.
                    

Statistics on annual average private sector rents to the end of September 2022, based predominantly on advertised rent data, have been released today by Scotlandâ€™s Chief Statistician.
Average rents for two bedroom properties, the most common type of private rented home in Scotland, have increased in 17 out of 18 areas of Scotland compared with the previous year.
Increases in seven of these areas were above the annual rate of inflation of 7.6%, ranging from 7.7% in Greater Glasgow up to 10.3% in South Lanarkshire. Meanwhile the average two bedroom rent in the Ayrshires decreased by 1.5%.
These regional trends combine to show an estimated 6.2% annual increase in average two bedroom monthly rents at a Scotland level.
Average rents increased at a Scotland level across all property size categories, with increases of 6.3%, 6.2%, 7.4%, 7.5% and 6.9% for one to four bedroom and one bedroom shared properties respectively.
Over the longer term, average rents in Lothian and Greater Glasgow have increased above the rate of inflation of 33.7% between 2010 and 2022 across all property sizes, whilst the Ayrshires, Dumfries and Galloway, North Lanarkshire and West Dunbartonshire have seen increases in average rents of less than the rate of inflation across all property sizes.
Background
These statistics refer to the average 12 month UK Consumer Price Index rate of inflation, which was 7.6% across the year to end September 2022, and which has been 33.7% between the year to end September 2010 and the year to end September 2022.
The full statistical publication includes main findings on rent levels for one bedroom, two bedroom, three bedroom, four bedroom, and one bedroom shared properties. It presents information on rent levels for these property sizes across each of the 18 broad rental market areas in Scotland and contains information on average rents as well as rents at the higher and lower end of the market.
The publication uses data from the Rent Service Scotland market evidence database, which is collected for the purposes of determining annual Local Housing Allowance levels and Local Reference Rent. The rental information contained in the market evidence database is largely based on advertised rents, therefore it is important to note that the statistics presented in this publication do not represent rent changes for existing tenants.
In addition, note that these statistics cover the period to year end September 2022, and so largely pre-date the Programme for Government proposals for emergency cost of living rent freeze legislation announced on 6 September 2022.
Official statistics are produced in accordance with the Code of Practice for Statistics.            ",11/29/2022,"Private Sector Rent Statistics, 2010 to 2022"

                        Starting salary for a fully qualified teacher to reach Â£35,650.
                    

A new progressive pay offer â€“ the fourth which has been made to unions - recognises the impact of the cost of living crisis on lower-paid teachers, with an increase of up to 6.85%.
For those classroom teachers on the main grade scale, who benefit from pay progression, this offer will mean an increase in one year of over 10%.
Those at the top of the scale will receive a 5% increase, taking their salary to Â£44,453. A teacher moving from probation into a fully qualified post would gain an annual salary increase of 27%.
A fully qualified teacher in Scotland would receive Â£35,650 â€“ over Â£7,500 more than their counterparts in England under the offer. The most experienced classroom teachers would receive Â£5,600 more than they would if they were teaching in England on the main pay range.
Overall, if accepted, this would represent a cumulative pay increase for the majority of teachers of 21.8% since 2018.
Education Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said:
""This is a fair offer which recognises that the cost of living crisis is the priority, with higher increases for staff on lower salaries.Â 
""This is now the fourth offer that has been made. In the same time EIS have not changed their request for a 10% pay increase â€“ even for those on the highest incomes.
""I have been clear that we have limited room for manoeuvre. The financial situation for the Scottish Government is challenging and additional money for teacher pay means reduced public services elsewhere.
""In these challenging times it is important we focus our attention on those who are most impacted by the cost of living crisis, as well as ensuring fairness to all public sector workers. I would urge leadership to postpone plans for industrial action and consider this new offer.â€
Background
The offer will mean a minimum increase of Â£1,926 or 5%, whichever is higher, for those earning up to Â£60,000. Everybody earning over Â£60,000 p.a. will still receive a pay increase of Â£3,000.

                        Roadmap to fair, green prosperity for communities and regions.
                    

Improvements to health, tackling child poverty and reaching climate goals are at the heart of a toolkit to support local economies to be fairer, greener, healthier and more resilient.
The Wellbeing Economy Toolkit: Supporting place-based economic strategy and policy development enables local authorities to identify and measure local wellbeing metrics including health, child poverty, levels of greenhouse gas emissions and fair work, and prioritise investments and policies to improve them.
This will include:
the creation of more high quality, sustainable local jobs by using more local and regional procurement contracts
improved transport links to help people access services and work
better access to the natural environment, which leads to better mental and physical health
The Constitution Secretary announced the toolkit at the Wealth of Nations 2.0 conference at the University of Glasgow. He was joined by representatives from fellow Wellbeing Economy Governments (WEGo) of Finland and Wales to take questions from young people, five years on from the first conversations to establish the network.
Constitution Secretary Angus Robertson said:
â€œThe need for a new economic model has never been clearer, and thatâ€™s why I think the wellbeing economy approach is gaining so much interest, both here, and around the world.
â€œWe see that in the growth of WEGo - the network of wellbeing economy governments â€“ which began as a coalition of Scotland, Iceland and New Zealand. Since this event was last held in 2020, two more governments â€“ Finland and Wales â€“ have joined, and other countries including Canada are showing a growing interest.
â€œCreating a wellbeing economy remains a defining mission for the Scottish Government, and it is my firm belief that Scotland could use the powers of independence to achieve that aim more fully.Â 
â€œBuilding a wellbeing economy is a huge challenge for any country, at any time. The current crises we are facing make it harder, but they also underline why we need to make this transformation as a matter of urgency.â€
Jimmy Paul, Director of Wellbeing Economy Alliance Scotland, said:Â 
""This practical new toolkit will be an invaluable resource for developing local economic strategies that really work for communities.
â€œAmidst the cost of living and climate crises, itâ€™s never been more important that economic approaches start with the goal of ensuring we all have what we need to live good lives and protect the health of our natural world, rather than continuing to centre outdated metrics like GDP growth. The toolkit could provide a step-change in the way local economic strategies are delivered in Scotland.â€

                        No measures to ease pressure on devolved budgets.
                    

Â 
The UK Governmentâ€™s Autumn Statement fails to address the pressure on devolved budgets to help people with the cost of living crisis, support public services, and finance fair pay offers, according to Deputy First Minister John Swinney.
Reacting to Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Huntâ€™s fiscal announcement, Mr Swinney expressed dismay at his failure to address the impact of inflation on the Scottish Governmentâ€™s budget, when businesses and households continue to face financial uncertainty and Â£1 billion in savings have had to be found to help those who need it most.
The Deputy First Minister said:
â€œTodayâ€™s statement shows that households across Scotland are paying a steep price for the economic mismanagement of the UK Government, with average household disposable incomes forecast to fall by 7% in real terms according to the Office for Budget Responsibility. This would erode just under 10 years of growth in living standards, taking them back toÂ levelsÂ notÂ seen since 2013-14, meaning they would not recover to pre-pandemic levels until after 2027-28 â€“ a devastating indictment of the UK Governmentâ€™s management of the economy.
â€œInflation is eating away at the Scottish budget, and due to the lack of additional funding in 2022-23 and the financial restrictions of devolution, we have had no choice but to make savings of more than Â£1 billion.
â€œI welcome the Chancellorâ€™s decision to increase benefits in line with inflation from next financial year and retain the triple lock on pensions - both measures we have consistently called for. However, the higher energy price cap from April is still unsustainable for many households. The proposals may limit the impact for some consumers, but the UK Government needs to carefully consider the affect a Â£500 rise in energy bills will have on those who are in or at risk of fuel poverty. And thereâ€™s still no certainty on how businesses struggling to stay afloat will be supported from April after the Energy Bill Relief Scheme ends.
â€œThe constant U-turns on tax by the UK Government have made planning for the Scottish Budget more challenging this year. We will take time to consider the implications for Scotland before setting out our own plans as part of the normal budget process. I am pleased the Chancellor has finally listened to our calls to tax more of the windfall gains in the energy sector, but he should have gone further to remove the poorly targeted investment allowance, which only serves to encourage short-term investment in fossil fuels rather than promoting long-term, sustainable energy solutions.
â€œThis leaves me with the difficult task of setting Scotlandâ€™s Budget for 2023-24 with no hope of financial flexibility to make a real difference in the lives of those who need it most.â€            ",11/17/2022,Households â€˜paying a steep price for UK economic mismanagement'

                        New round of monitor farms to optimise production in the farming sector.
                    

The latest cycle of a programme promoting sustainable innovation and transformational change in the agricultural sector has taken a step forward.
Backed by Â£1.7 million of funding, nine farms across Scotland will take part in the Scottish Monitor Farm Programme (MFP).
The programme focusses on practical farming and good business practices to build resilient, dynamic farms focused on reaching full economic, social and environmental sustainability.
The project brings research and industry closer together to optimise production and sharing best-practice learning and experience across the agricultural sector.
Rural Affairs Secretary Mairi Gougeon said: â€œI am delighted to see the range of farms taking part in the Monitor Farm Project.
â€œThis long-running programme is ideally placed to support the wider agricultural sector to optimise production, contributing to our food security while helping meet our climate change and net zero targets.
â€œInnovation and sustainability has never been more important for an industry facing the significant challenges of the on-going war in Ukraine and against the backdrop of Covid-19, Brexit and the cost of living crisis.
â€œI would encourage farmers and crofters to engage with the programme and benefit from the shared knowledge and experiences that come from the Monitor Farm Project.â€
Monitor Farm Programme Manager Beth Alexander from Quality Meat Scotland said: â€œThe benefits of the programme extend well beyond the gates of the individual Monitor Farms.
â€œAn initial meeting takes place at each farm and these are open to the whole farming community, who are very much welcome to come along and join the discussions.
â€œWe want the learnings and the example set by Monitor farms to benefit all farmers across the whole of Scotland.â€
The latest round of MFP was launched in summer 2022 and runs until 2026.
Background
The Monitor Farm Scotland initiative is managed by Quality Meat Scotland and AHDB Cereals and Oilseeds with funding from the Scottish Government.
Now approaching its 20th anniversary, the MFP is the Scottish Governmentâ€™s principal farmer-led initiative
Each Monitor Farm will work closely with the Programme Manager, Regional Adviser, the farm staff and trusted advisers to establish the baseline technical, environmental, and financial performance of the farm business.
Each of the monitor farms will also have its own dedicated Management Team that will evaluate solutions and best practice before sharing its findings, both with the wider Community Groups and more generally through various media channels including a dedicated website.
The nine farms are located in: South Ayrshire, Strathspey, Banff and Buchan, Deeside, Stirlingshire, Roxburghshire, Dumfries, East Lothian and Argyll.            ",11/16/2022,Supporting agricultural innovation

                        Calls for inflationary uplift to Scottish Budget.
                    

A return to austerity would have significant consequences for people and public services, Deputy First Minister John Swinney has warned ahead of the UK Governmentâ€™s Autumn Statement.
Mr Swinney has called for an alternative to austerity to avoid the UK Government â€œprolongingâ€ the recession that the Bank of England forecasts may be the longest in 100 years.
The Deputy First Ministerâ€™s other urgent priorities include:
inflationary increases to devolved governmentsâ€™ 2022-23 budgets to support people, fair public sector pay uplifts and public services
increasing social security benefits in line with inflation in the new financial year, with an immediate and permanent Â£25 uplift to Universal Credit and a reversal of the two-child limit and benefits cap
retaining the triple lock on pensions
introducing an enhanced windfall tax to fund support for those most in need
Mr Swinney said:
â€œThe UK Government must not repeat the mistakes of the past. Scotland has already suffered a decade of UK Government imposed austerity which has disproportionately hurt the poorest and most vulnerable in society â€“ it does not work and will inflict misery on people, put pressure on our public services and hamper our economy.
â€œWith the UK forecast to enter recession in the coming months â€“ one the Bank of England warns may be the longest in 100 years â€“ cutting public spending risks prolonging that recession, hampering efforts to restore the public finances. The Chancellor must rule this out and pursue an alternative to austerity that invests in public services and the economy.
â€œWe are facing exceptional challenges â€“ a cost of living crisis, soaring inflation and a Scottish Government Budget which is worth Â£1.7 billion less than when it was introduced last December. An additional inflationary increase in the block grant is needed to support us in addressing these challenges, as part of an overall approach that balances long-term fiscal sustainability with the increases in public spending that are needed.â€
â€œThe prospects for next year and beyond are very concerning. Reductions in UK departmental spending on the scale that is being trailed would have severe knock-on impacts on the Scottish Budget and our public services. It is vital that the Chancellor takes steps to ensure that people are supported, public services are protected and devolved governments have the funding to deliver for the communities we serve.â€

                        Extension opens benefit to more than 400,000 children.
                    

The Scottish Child Payment has today been increased to Â£25 and been extended to include eligible children up to age 16.
First launched in February 2021 at Â£10 per week per child for children under the age of six, the Scottish Child Payment - unique to Scotland - provides direct financial support to eligible families and carers.
Around 104,000 children already getting the payment will automatically see the payment increase to Â£25 per week â€“ which represents a 150% increase within eight months. This is also the rate for all those now eligible up to age 16.
Following todayâ€™s extension, it is forecast that a further 300,000 children across the country will be eligible.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon today encouraged all eligible families to apply on a visit to Golfhill Primary and Whitehill Secondary schools at their shared campus in Dennistoun, Glasgow.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:
â€œThis is an important day for many families across Scotland as we make significant extra financial support available to tackle child poverty. The Scottish Child Payment is unique to Scotland and is the most ambitious child poverty reduction measure in the UK.
â€œAt a time when the cost of living crisis is causing significant hardship for many families, this increased payment of Â£1300 per eligible child is even more vital, and the age extension means that it is now available to many more children.
â€œWe want to make sure that everyone gets the help available to them. Parents or carers who are on universal credit or other benefits and who have children under 16 should check through Social Security Scotland if they are eligible.â€
John Dickie, Director of Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland, said:
â€œThe roll-out of the Scottish Child Payment to over fives and the increase in its value to Â£25 a week marks a hugely welcome day for struggling families across Scotland and a real step on the road toward ending child poverty.
â€œThis is a significant and uniquely Scottish boost to family incomes at a time when it is needed more than ever. Itâ€™s now vital that we all spread the word as widely as possible and ensure that all eligible families apply and every child that is entitled benefits.â€
Â 
Background
Scottish Child Payment is part of a wider package of five family payments including: Best Start Grant Pregnancy and Baby Payment, Best Start Grant Early Learning Payment, Best Start Grant School Age Payment and Best Start Foods
Plans have also been announced to automatically pay the Best Start Grant Early Learning and School Age Payments to parents and carers who already receive Scottish Child Payment when their children become eligible. The change will be introduced later this month
The Scottish Government estimates that the extended and increased payment could lift 50,000 children out of poverty in 2023/24, a reduction of five percentage points according to the latest Scottish Government forecasts issued in March.
Ahead of todayâ€™s Scottish Child Payment extension and increase, the Scottish Government introduced bridging payments worth Â£520 a year to provide immediate support to around 145,000 children and young people of school age. A doubled payment of Â£260 will be made to eligible people in December.
Families, and carers can find out more and apply at mygov.scot/scottishchildpayment or by calling Social Security Scotland free on 0800 182 2222
Given the large numbers, the Scottish Government is expecting a high number of applications. This means that eligible people applying for the first time might need to wait to get their payment, with all payments calculated from the day they applied.
Families who already get Scottish Child Payment for a child under the age of six can add older children to their existing award.

                        Joint letter to UK Government.
                    

The UK Government has been urged to increase the amount of funding available for NHS pay.
Ahead of the Autumn statement, Health Secretary Humza Yousaf and Welsh Health Minister Eluned Morgan have written to UK Health Secretary Steve Barclay to ask for additional funding to help avert strike action this winter in the NHS.
The letter reads:
â€œWe wanted to write to you in advance of the Chancellorâ€™s Autumn Statement on 17th November to once again make the case for additional funding for our hardworking NHS staff.
â€œIn recent weeks the Deputy First Minister of Scotland and the Welsh Government Minister for Finance and Local Government have written to His Majestyâ€™s Treasury to make clear the need for additional funding for public services.
â€œThe Royal College of Nursing have announced a sweeping legal mandate for industrial action across the UK. In Scotland, they have joined several other unions representing NHS staff in gaining a legal mandate for industrial action with ballots expected to confirm a mandate in the rest of the UK.
â€œThe risk to the NHS of industrial action this winter is profound, and we all need to do all we can to avert industrial action in any form. The NHS across the UK continues to feel the effects of the pandemic as it recovers and remobilises, and any action is likely to have catastrophic effects in all parts of the UK.Â Â Â Â 
â€œWe are experiencing a cost of living crisis and the anger of NHS staff is entirely understandable. Sky rocketing inflation combined with high interest rates, a direct result of the havoc caused by the UK Governmentâ€™s mini-budget, means that we are simply unable to come close to matching the expectations of NHS staff across the country. While the support provided by the UK Government on areas such as support for energy bills is welcome, it has not gone nearly far enough.
â€œMedia reports suggest that the Chancellor is considering reimposing austerity on the people of the UK again, for which there is no mandate, through extensive spending cuts. That would be a disaster for our public services, including the NHS, at a time when they need more investment, not less.
â€œWe would therefore implore you to work with us to make the case to the Chancellor in advance of his Autumn Statement for increased funding for the NHS and the devolved governments as a whole, primarily to pay our hard working NHS staff a fair pay rise in the face of the cost of living crisis this winter, and avoid what could be catastrophic industrial action in the NHS.â€

                        Early learning and childcare savings.
                    

Families of more than 83,200 children are saving around Â£5,000 per eligible child per year, thanks to the Scottish Governmentâ€™s Early Learning and Childcare (ELC) offer.
Latest figures show a year-on-year increase in children accessing funded ELC.
The number taking up the full offer of 1,140 hours a year is also up from this time last year. If families paid for this themselves, it would cost them around Â£5,000 per eligible child per year.
A total of 93,902 children aged two to five were accessing funded ELC at the start of September â€“ a 3% rise from the same time last year. Of those, 83,237 - 89% - were benefiting from the 1,140 hours offer.
Childrenâ€™s Minister Clare Haughey said:
â€œScotland is the only part of the UK to offer 1,140 hours a year of funded early learning and childcare to all three and four-year-olds and eligible two-year-olds.
â€œThis offer saves families a significant amount of money, which is particularly important at a time when so many are struggling with cost of living pressures. It also supports parents into work, training or study.
â€œHigh-quality ELC benefits children, too, by enriching their early years and giving them the confidence and skills they need to prepare them for school.
â€œWe intend to expand our childcare offer even further, including building a future system of school age childcare and a new early learning and childcare offer for one and two-year-olds, starting with those who need it most.â€
COSLA Children and Young People Spokesperson Councillor Tony Buchanan said:Â 
â€œIâ€™m pleased that todayâ€™s figures confirm that nearly 94,000 two to five-year-old children are accessing funded Early Learning and Childcare delivered by Scotlandâ€™s Councils and their partners, which represents a 3% increase on the position a year ago.
â€œA greater proportion of children are accessing the full 1,140 hours entitlement, compared with April this year. The increased availability of funded ELC is allowing children more time to play and learn, and more opportunities for parents and carers to work, study or volunteer, as well significant financial savings for families at a time when this is so desperately needed.â€Â 
Background
Early Learning and Childcare Delivery Progress Report
In August 2021, 90,890 children were in funded childcare, with 79,262 - 87% - accessing 1,140 hours.
The total number of children eligible for funded ELC increases throughout the academic year as more children turn three years old.
Legislation came into effect on 1 August 2021 to make the expanded offer of 1,140 hours available across Scotland.

                        Additional funding to help those most in need.
                    

Measures announced today will provide further help to those most impacted by the cost of living crisis while tackling budget pressures caused by rising inflation and economic uncertainty.
The Emergency Budget Review (EBR) for 2022-23 identifies funding of around Â£35 million for a range of initiatives to support people with the increased cost of living, including doubling the Fuel Insecurity Fund, doubling the Scottish Child Bridging Payment to Â£260 and a new Â£1.4 million Island Cost Crisis Emergency Fund to help island households manage higher energy costs.
Significant investment in public sector pay deals â€“ delivering higher increases in pay for low earners â€“ is also designed to help families and individuals deal with the cost of living crisis.
Other measures include:
confirming funds to local authorities to support Discretionary Housing Payments
establishing a Joint Taskforce with business, COSLA, local authorities and agencies to consider the differing impacts of regulation on business
extending energy advice to businesses by investing Â£300,000 to expand the services of Business Energy Scotland, while doubling the value of the SME energy efficiency Loan and Cash Back Scheme for energy efficiency to Â£20,000
new payment break options to help protect those who have agreed to repay debt through the Debt Arrangement Scheme but face unexpected increases in the cost of living
Additional savings of Â£615 million have been identified to enable enhanced public sector pay offers to be made while maintaining a route to complying with Ministersâ€™ responsibility to balance the budget. They follow savings of Â£560 million announced on 7 September.
Deputy First Minister John Swinney said:
â€œThere has never been a time of greater pressure on the public finances.
â€œThe Scottish Government's budget today is worth Â£1.7 billion less than when it was published last December. At the same time, demand for government support and intervention is understandably increasing while we continue to try to fund increased public sector pay claims, particularly for those on lowest incomes.
â€œThese savings are not ones we would wish to make, but in the absence of additional funding from the UK Government, we are left with no alternative.Â 
â€œWe must balance the books while prioritising funding to help families, back business, provide fair pay awards and to protect the delivery of public services. This Emergency Budget Review delivers on these objectives.â€

Â The EBR consisted of a thorough review of all devolved spend planned for 2022-23, across all portfolios, to support a path to balance the budget in light of significant pressure (e.g. inflation, pay deals, increased demand), and to identify opportunities for savings to support measures to help with the cost of living crisis.Â The process was informed by a panel of leading economists.

                        Figures show continued trust in the Scottish Government.
                    

Three-quarters (75%) of people in Scotland believe the Scottish Government should have the most influence over the way the country is run, compared to just 14% who believe the UK Government should.
This yearâ€™s Scottish Social Attitudes Survey also shows 66% of people trust the Scottish Government to work in the countryâ€™s best interests.
The survey measured the publicâ€™s views on a range of issues including influence over how Scotland is run, levels of tax and government priorities, the economy, NHS and political engagement.
Its findings reflect emerging public concern in the cost of living crisis, with 66% of respondents believing the economy had got weaker in the previous 12 months.
The survey has previously been conducted face to face but as a result of coronavirus restrictions in place at the time of fieldwork, this yearâ€™s survey was completed via telephone.
This change in methodology has impacted the nature of the sample and responses received, and as a result has affected comparability with survey data from previous years. This yearâ€™s report solely focusses on data from this yearâ€™s survey rather than examining trends over time.
The findings also show:
64% of people thought the level of taxation and spending on health, education and social benefits should be increased, whilst 32% thought the level of taxation and spending should stay the same
68% agreed that income should be redistributed from the better-off to those who are less well-off, while 16% disagreed
over half of people (54%) in Scotland were satisfied with the way NHS Scotland is run
98% of people thought it was important to vote in Scottish Parliament elections, 95% in local council elections and 92% in UK Government elections
64% of people thought the Scottish Parliament was giving Scotland a stronger voice in the UK and only 7% thought it was giving Scotland a weaker voice
Constitution Secretary Angus Robertson said:
â€œThe findings in this survey demonstrate continued faith in the Scottish Government to deliver on behalf of the people of Scotland. They clearly show that despite these uncertain times, people agree with the Scottish Governmentâ€™s priorities to build a fairer, greener, wealthier Scotland.
â€œDespite these figures being from earlier in the year it is clear the cost of living crisis was starting to impact family finances and alarm bells were ringing about the economy. The Scottish Government is working tirelessly to provide support to those who need it most. We are increasing the Scottish Child Payment to Â£25 per week and extending it to eligible children under 16 in the coming weeks, helping thousands of additional families this winter. We are also continuing to urge the UK Government to take all of the necessary steps to support the most vulnerable through this profoundly difficult time.
â€œGiven the clear democratic mandate we have, not to mention the continued trust the public has in the Scottish Government to act in their interest, we will work to ensure people have a choice on independence, ensuring that choice is an informed one.â€

                        New annual publication provides estimates of benefit take-up rates.
                    

A new annual publication with estimated take-up rates of Scottish social security benefits has been published for the first time.
The report will help track progress against the Scottish Governmentâ€™s Benefit Take-up Strategy which is a requirement of the 2018 Social Security (Scotland) Act.
The Scottish Government is committed to delivering a transparent social security system and reporting annually on progress will support that aim. This first publication covers estimates from introduction of the benefits up to the end of March in the 2021-2022 financial year and will sit alongside existing performance reporting on Social Security Scotland.
Minister for Social Security Ben Macpherson said:
â€œWe are committed to making sure everyone gets the financial support they are entitled to and our benefit take-up strategy outlines how we are doing this. We actively work to encourage take-up of Scottish social security benefits by promoting our 12 benefits, collaborating with various organisations and removing barriers to access.
â€œThis new publication of estimated take-up rates provides us with valuable insights, and will help us to identify where we can do more. Our commitment to continuous improvement ensures we are making progress in breaking down the barriers to access, and in reducing stigma that may have previously led to people not accessing the benefits they are entitled to.
â€œFor example, we have been working with supermarket retailers to promote Best Start Foods, we have shared over 42,000 leaflets about our five family payments and Child Disability Payment in NHS Scotlandâ€™s baby boxes, and we have included information on Scottish social security benefits in welcome packs supporting refugees.
â€œOur efforts to maximise incomes and support benefit take-up are even more important during the current cost of living crisis. Our new cost of living website is a trusted â€˜one stop shopâ€™ for advice and information about financial support available in Scotland, including all our Scottish benefits. I would encourage everyone to use and share this website, to make sure people are accessing the financial support they are entitled to.â€Â 
Background:

A take-up rate is the percentage of people entitled to a benefit that actually receive it. While the number of people receiving Scottish social security benefits is known through published official statistics, the number of people eligible to receive these benefits has to be estimated internally by Scottish Government analysts using a range of data sources. This means the take-up rates in this publication are estimates only.

Since the Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018 was passed, the Scottish Government has introduced 12 benefits, seven of which are completely new forms of financial support, only available in Scotland
When all benefits have been introduced and clients have transferred from the Department for Work and Pensions, Social Security Scotland will support approximately 2 million children and adults â€“ around one in three people in Scotland.

                        A Fair Work approach to the cost of living crisis.
                    

A record proportion of employees in Scotland are being paid the real Living Wage (rLW) or more, new figures reveal.
The Office for National Statisticsâ€™ Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings shows 91% of employees aged 18 and over earned at least the rLW in 2022, an increase from 85.5% in 2021 and the highest proportion since the rLW series began in 2012.
In comparison, 87.5% of employees aged 18 and over in England are paid the rLW or more, 88.2% in Wales and 85.4% in Northern Ireland.
The ONS survey also confirms that the Gender Pay Gap is lower in Scotland than across the UK as a whole. For full-time employees the gap is 3.7% compared with the UK figure of Â 8.3%.
The Scottish Government is committed to tackling the cost of living crisis with a Fair Work approach, ensuring workers are paid at least the rLW - currently Â£10.90 per hour - and supporting more women into jobs through flexible working opportunities.
Minister for Employment and Fair Work Richard Lochhead said:
â€œThe Scottish Governmentâ€™s commitment to promoting payment of the real Living Wage is a fundamental part of our National Strategy for Economic Transformation and a key cost of living policy to deliver a fairer and more equal society.
â€œThe ONS figures confirm that Scottish employers are leading the way and we can be proud of the progress that has been made.
â€œThere is still work to be done on tackling the gender pay gap, but we are taking steps to make this happen. We will publish our refreshed Fair Work Action Plan later this year, outlining the actions needed to close the gap further and create a more diverse and inclusive workplace. We will continue to work with employers, employability providers and partners to achieve this aim.â€Â 
Background
Read the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings statistics in full here.
The Surveyâ€™s estimates are for April 2022 when the rLW rate was Â£9.90 - and Â£11.05 for employees in London. The rate of Â£10.90 for employees outside London was announced in September 2022. Employers should implement the rise as soon as possible but have until May 2023 to implement it. Find out more on the real Living Wage here.
In 2022, the gender pay gap for all employees in Scotland was 12.2% compared to the gender pay gap for all employees in the UK at 14.9%.

                        Rents frozen and evictions prevented.
                    

Emergency legislation giving tenants increased protection from rent increases and evictions during the cost of living crisis has become law after receiving Royal Assent.
The Cost of Living (Tenant Protection) Act gives Ministers temporary power to cap rent increases for private and social tenants, as well as for student accommodation.
This applies to in-tenancy rent increases, with the cap set at 0% from 6 September 2022 until at least 31 March 2023, effectively freezing rents for most tenants during this period.
Enforcement of eviction actions resulting from the cost crisis are prevented over the same period except in a number of specified circumstances, and damages for unlawful evictions have been increased to a maximum of 36 monthsâ€™ worth of rent.
Tenantsâ€™ Rights Minister Patrick Harvie said:
â€œMany people who rent their homes are facing real difficulties as a result of the cost of living crisis. While bills are rising for all of us, many tenants are more exposed as they are more likely to be on low incomes or living in poverty than other people.
â€œThese measures aim to give tenants greater confidence about their housing costs and the security of a stable home.
â€œSome landlords may be feeling the effects of this crisis too. So while the primary purpose is to protect tenants, the emergency measures also include safeguards for those landlords who may be impacted.Â 
â€œFor anyone struggling with their rent, I would urge you to contact your landlord, an advice organisation or a tenantsâ€™ union to get help as early as possible.â€

                        All NHS workers offered Â£2,205 pay rise.
                    

NHS staff are set to receive a record pay rise of Â£2,205 - an average 7% pay uplift - to help tackle the cost of living crisis and retain staff during the tougher winter months.Â 
This increased offer was made after constructive negotiations between the Scottish Government and NHS Unions, which lasted into the early hours of Friday morning (21 October).
The offer would mean the lowest paid seeing a rise of more than 11%, with qualified nursing staff receiving up to 8.45%, helping the lowest paid staff through the cost of living crisis.Â 
If agreed, the pay uplift, which amounts to almost half a billion pounds (Â£480m), will benefit more than 160,000 employees including nurses, paramedics, allied health professionals and healthcare support staff. Â 
This is the largest pay offer given to NHS Scotland Agenda for Change staff since devolution and will mean they remain the best paid in the UK. If accepted, the offer will be backdated to 1 April 2022, and could be added to pay cheques in time for Christmas.
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said:
â€œI am grateful to trade union colleagues and NHS employers for constructive discussions on pay. This has been another exceptionally challenging year for our health service and we have a difficult winter ahead, but I am pleased that we are able to recognise the service and dedication of our healthcare and support staff with this pay offer.
â€œWe owe NHS staff a debt of gratitude for leading us through the greatest public health crisis in recent history.
â€œThis improved pay offer â€“ which is the largest of its kind since devolution - reflects their hard work and will go a long way to help them through the cost of living crisis. We are rightly focussing the biggest increases for those who are the lowest paid, as we know the cost crisis is impacting them disproportionately.â€            ",10/21/2022,Record pay offer for NHS staff

                        First Minister convenes second summit with energy companies and advice organisations.
                    

Further actions to support consumers and businesses through the winter have been agreed at a virtual summit between energy companies and advice organisations and Ministers.
The energy cost crisis summit discussed this weekâ€™s reversals to UK Government measures set out since the previous summit, and agreed longer-term certainty is urgently needed ahead of the anticipated energy price cap increase, currently due in April.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:
â€œThe curtailing of the Energy Price Guarantee by the Chancellor of the Exchequer earlier this week has eradicated what meagre certainty people and businesses had over their bills and finances in the short to medium-term. Even the current cap of Â£2,500 until April â€“ while better than a rise to Â£3,500 â€“ is still a very significant increase for households who are already struggling to pay their bills and heat their homes. Without further mitigation the increase to Â£2,500 under the Energy Price Guarantee will see an additional 150,000 households in extreme fuel poverty.
â€œThe deficiencies in the UK Governmentâ€™s package mean we are still in an emergency situation. The economic outlook has been made far worse by other aspects of the mini-budget â€“ most of which have now had to be reversed entirely.
â€œThe Scottish Government is working hard within its limited powers and finite budget to support people, business, public services and the economy. Part of that work will involve ongoing engagement with energy companies and advice organisations throughout the winter to see how, individually and collectively, we can alleviate the huge challenges people are facing as well as signposting existing schemes and support that is available.
â€œIt is clear however that more substantial reform of the energy market is needed to address the issue in the long term, and the power to do so lies with the UK Government.â€
Background
Scottish Energy Retail Summit: update on collaborative action - gov.scot (www.gov.scot)
In October, the UK Government announced the Energy Price Guarantee for domestic consumers and the Energy Bills Relief Scheme for businesses. Following these announcements, the group reconvened on 20 October to discuss the implications on suppliers, advice organisations, the third sector, businesses and consumers, including those off-grid who are not part of an energy supply contract.
The following themes were identified for the Scottish Government, energy suppliers, advice organisations and business groups to explore in more detail moving forward:
The Scottish Government will work with Energy UK and other organisations to increase smart meter coverage in Scotland, with a particular focus on rural areas
partners will share data with the Scottish Government to help inform calls upon the UK Government, to provide clarity on continued support for domestic and non-domestic consumers as soon as possible
The Scottish Government will work with the business sector to explore how businesses can be supported with energy costs, within our devolved powers
ensuring maximum coordination of energy efficiency information and advice services to all consumers
To fully realise the aims of these work streams the Scottish Government has called on the UK Government to take further action with a particular focus on:
accelerating the review of the Energy Price Guarantee scheme to ensure domestic consumers have clarity on energy costs after 31 March next year
additional targeted support to be delivered to support vulnerable consumers who are already struggling to pay their bills and heat their homes
doing more to support households across Scotland who rely on alternative fuels to heat their homes
clarify protections for businesses following 31 of March 2023 as soon as possible to ensure businesses in Scotland have the certainty and security they need to operate with confidence, while identifying 'vulnerable non domestic customers' and offering all vulnerable SMEâ€™s guaranteed support past March 2023

                        Paper outlines plans for fairer labour market.
                    

AÂ new single rate for the national minimum wage to reflect the increased cost of living, and more effective employment law to protect workersâ€™ rights underpin plans to build a fairer labour market in an independent Scotland, according to Deputy First Minister John Swinney.
Following publication of the paper Building a New Scotland: A stronger economy with independence, Mr Swinney said the powers of independence would allow the Scottish Government to build a fairer, more equal future for all workers. This includes new measures to improve access to flexible working and better industrial relations.
Deputy First Minister John Swinney said:
â€œImproving job security, wages and work-life balance are essential to delivering a more socially just Scotland. The UK labour market model has generated high income inequality while failing to drive productivity growth.
â€œCompared to independent European countries similar to Scotland, the UK has a higher prevalence of low pay, a bigger gender pay gap, longer working hours and significantly lower statutory sick pay.
â€œThe Scottish Government is committed to Fair Work, but we could go much further to strengthen that agenda in an independent Scotland, developing a legal framework that more effectively addresses the workplace challenges of the 21st century. It would give us an opportunity to redesign the system to better meet the needs of Scotlandâ€™s workers and employers.â€
Specific measures proposed in the paper include:
establishing a Scottish Fair Pay Commission to lead a new approach to setting a national minimum wage, working with employers, trade unions and government
improving pay and conditions with a single rate minimum wage for all age groups and better access to flexible work to help parents and carers
repealing the UK Trade Union Act 2016 as part of developing an approach to industrial relations which suits both workers and employers
introducing a law to help workers organise co-operative buyouts or rescues when a business is up for sale or under threat
legislating to support workers in precarious employment, and banning the practice of staff being made redundant and re-hired on reduced wages and conditions
increasing transparency in pay reporting and data to address gender, ethnicity and disability pay gaps and building on Scottish Government work to break down barriers to employment
The paper outlines how it would be easier for an independent Scotland to deal with labour market shocks. In responding to the global financial crisis and pandemic, other countries were able to quickly draw on existing institutions and initiatives. This could include a permanent short-time working scheme, modelled on the German Kurzarbeit programme which provides compensation for private sector workers whose hours are reduced because of economic difficulty. A scheme like this in Scotland could help retain skills, reduce long-term unemployment and the associated costs and allow for more rapid economic recovery.
Job Security Councils, modelled on a Swedish initiative, could provide support to workers who have lost â€“ or are at risk of losing â€“ their jobs. These non-profit foundations led by social partners, employer representative bodies and trades unions, would help workers find new employment by providing a range of advice and high-quality retraining.

                        First Minister announces doubling of December Bridging Payment to Â£260.
                    

Families of an estimated 145,000 children will benefit from extra support this winter to help with cost of living pressures â€“ backed by Scottish Government investment of Â£18.9 million.
Bridging Payments were introduced in 2021 ahead of the extension of the Scottish Child Payment to 6-15 year olds. The final quarterly Bridging Payment, due in December, will now be doubled to Â£260, meaning families will receive up to Â£650 per eligible child this year.
All children registered to receive free school meals on the basis of family low income are eligible and will receive this payment automatically.
Total Scottish Government funding for the Bridging Payments will increase to an estimated Â£169 million across 2021 and 2022.
This is in addition to the Scottish Child Payment which will be extended to all eligible under-16s from 14 November and will rise to Â£25 per child per week on the same date â€“ a 150% increase in the benefit within eight months.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:
â€œI am proud of the work the Scottish Government is doing to tackle child poverty. The Scottish Child Payment is paid to eligible families and is unique in the United Kingdom. It started for under-6s at Â£10 per week per eligible child. In April we doubled it to Â£20.Â  Five weeks from today we will increase it again, to Â£25 and will also extend it to families with children up to age 16.
â€œThat is vital financial help for well over 100,000 children, delivered in time for Christmas. That is the sign of a government with the right priorities.
â€œBut we need to do more because we know this winter is going to be really tough. Rather than looking forward to Christmas, too many families will be dreading it because they donâ€™t know if they can afford to heat their homes or even pay for food.
â€œAs part of our help to the poorest families over last year and this, ahead of rolling out the Scottish Child Payment to under 16s, we have made quarterly bridging payments of Â£130 to children and young people in receipt of free school meals.
â€œI am delighted that the Scottish Government will double the December Payment from Â£130 to Â£260.
â€œThat will help put food on the Christmas table for families of 145,000 children and young people. I donâ€™t pretend it will make all of their worries go away â€“ no government with our limited powers can ever do that. But I hope this investment of almost Â£20 million will bring a bit of Christmas cheer to those who need it most.â€
Background
Bridging Payments were introduced in 2021 ahead of the roll out of the Scottish Child Payment to under 16s. The Â£130 payments are paid quarterly by councils on behalf of the Scottish Government. Families received up to Â£520 per eligible child in 2021 and will receive up to Â£650 in 2022. Bridging Payments support around 145,000 school age children.
The Scottish Government will make available additional funds to double the December payment. Delivery is subject to approval by COSLA Leaders.
Scotland is the only nation in the UK offering the Scottish Child Payment, one of five family benefits delivered by the Scottish Government to support low income parents with the costs of raising a child. Scottish Child Payment is currently available to families of eligible children under 6 years old and will open to applications for under 16s from 14 November.

A veterans support fund is now open to help improve the lives of former service personnel and their families.
A key priority for this yearâ€™s Scottish Veterans Fund is to make sure veterans and their families are supported in response to the ongoing cost of living crisis.
The fund will also target support for veterans who have left the Services early, as well as promoting collaboration between both veterans charities and non-veterans organisations.
Since the Scottish Government created the fund in 2008 almost 200 individual projects have been supported, receiving more than Â£2.3 million. In 2021, the annual funding provided was more than doubled to Â£500,000, with individual projects now able to bid for up to Â£50,000 a year.
Cabinet Secretary for Justice and Veterans, Keith Brown said:
â€œScotlandâ€™s veterans community has given a great deal to society and it is right that we do all we can to provide the best possible care and support when they return to civilian life.
â€œIt is important that the fund responds to issues that veterans are currently facing and this year we are looking to support projects that will help veterans and their families through the cost of living crisis.
â€œWe will continue to target projects that provide new and innovative approaches to aiding our veterans community. In particular, bids that promote collaboration within and between the veterans charity sector and other non-veterans organisations, as well as support for early service leavers, are being prioritised.â€
Scottish Veterans Commissioner Susie Hamilton, who chairs the independent panel that assesses bids for the Fund, said:
â€œI am delighted to see the continuation of this support to those leaving the Service, veterans and their families. The priorities of supporting vulnerable early service leavers and those most affected by the current cost crisis are particularly welcome and important in the current difficult circumstances. Organisations working together can produce a powerful impact, so I hope to see collaboration and partnerships feature in this yearâ€™s applications.
""We all benefit when veterans and their families are able to prosper after military service and I look forward to seeing the range of bids that will be put forward to help make that happen.â€

Tenants will have increased protection from rent increases and evictions during the cost of living crisis under temporary legislation passed by the Scottish Parliament.
The Cost of Living (Tenant Protection) Bill gives Ministers temporary power to cap rents for private and social tenants, as well as for student accommodation. The Bill also introduces a moratorium on evictions.
This cap, which applies to in-tenancy rent increases, has initially been set at 0% from 6 September 2022 until at least 31 March 2023. Ministers have the power to vary the rent cap while it is in force. The measures can be extended over two further six-month periods.
Enforcement of eviction actions resulting from the cost crisis are prevented over the same period except in a number of specified circumstances, and damages for unlawful evictions have been increased to a maximum of 36 monthsâ€™ worth of rent.
The temporary legislation balances the protections that are needed for tenants with some safeguards for those landlords who may also be impacted by the cost crisis.
Tenantsâ€™ Rights Minister Patrick Harvie said:
â€œI am pleased that Parliament has passed this Bill to support tenants through the current cost of living crisis. People who rent their home are more likely to live in poverty or be on low incomes than other people, and many will be anxious about keeping up payments on their homes as their everyday expenses rise.
â€œWith this Bill now set to become law, tenants in the social or private rented sector, or in student accommodation, will have stability in their homes and housing costs.
â€œIâ€™m hugely grateful to MSPs for scrutinising and agreeing this legislation this week, ensuring these protections can be brought in with the urgency that this crisis demands.â€

The 2023-24 Scottish Budget will be published on 15 December 2022, the Deputy First Minister John Swinney has confirmed following agreement between the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliamentâ€™s Finance and Public Administration Committee (FPAC).
The agreed date provides certainty of Scotlandâ€™s plans and supports the Scottish Parliament to scrutinise the Scottish Governmentâ€™s spending plans for the next financial year.
In a letter to FPAC, Mr Swinney highlighted that the Scottish Fiscal Commission requires at least 10 weeks to prepare spending forecasts and said the â€œuncertainty and volatility of UK Governmentâ€™s plansâ€ means the Budget may need to be revisited if there are implications for this period.
Mr Swinney said:
â€œThere is no doubt that the challenges and obstacles of recent times have heavily impacted the way we live. Our continued recovery from the pandemic, the current cost of living crisis, the ongoing turmoil and uncertainty regarding the UK Governmentâ€™s plans for its Autumn budget and Russiaâ€™s illegal war in Ukraine all have implications on the people of Scotland and our economy.
â€œWe are not privy to discussions surrounding the UK Governmentâ€™s ever changing Autumn budget plans, despite the clear and obvious impact this has on our ability to plan our 2023-24 Budget. The Scottish Budget will be informed by voices across Scotland to ensure we continue to deliver to build a fairer, greener and more prosperous country.
â€œI look forward to working with stakeholders and the Committee to ensure a Budget is delivered which puts the priorities of the Scottish people at the forefront and continues to strengthen our economy.â€

                        Support highlighted during Challenge Poverty Week.
                    

Families and friends have a crucial role to play in ensuring Scotlandâ€™s social security payments reach those who need them most.
On a visit to a Citizens Advice Bureau, as part of Challenge Poverty Week, Social Security Minister Ben Macpherson said talking about benefits would help drive take-up and reduce stigma about accessing benefits. The Scottish Government urges people to make sure they get the benefits they are entitled to.
These payments provide support to people on low incomes, people with disabilities, carers, and young people entering the workplace.
During the visit to the Citizens Advice Bureau in Muirhouse, Edinburgh, Mr Macpherson met staff and volunteers who provide information and advice about available financial assistance and wider support.
Â Minister for Social Security Ben Macpherson said:
â€œWe are urging as many people as possible to talk to family, friends and other people they know to encourage them to apply for benefits they may be entitled to. We want people to get any support that they are eligible for.
â€œWe know that word of mouth helps to raise awareness of Social Security Scotlandâ€™s payments, and those provided by the UK Government which may be needed to access Scottish benefits. We also want anyone who thinks they might be eligible for payments to check whatâ€™s available to them.
â€œWhile several of our payments are designed for people on low incomes there are also others which provide support to disabled people, young people starting their careers after a period of unemployment, and carers including young carers.
â€œSocial security is a shared investment in people and supports building a fairer, more equal society. The current cost of living crisis shows that any of us could need this support at some point in our lives. That is why it is right that we invest in social security together.
â€œThe Scottish Government is grateful for the impactful role that Citizens Advice advisers play in promoting and supporting access to social security.â€
Citizens Advice Edinburgh Chief Executive Benjamin Napier said:Â 
""The Citizens Advice network in ScotlandÂ encourages everyone to check that they are receiving the income they are entitled to.
â€œEvery year, millions of pounds of welfare entitlement go unclaimed. At a time of increasing costs and pressures on household budgets, we strongly encourage people to get in touch with their local Citizens Advice Bureau or use our online tools likeÂ www.moneymap.scot to see if they could be receiving more money. Last year the CAB network across Scotland helped over 174,000 people and 2.4 million people checked our online advice pages.Â 
â€œAdvice from CABs is free, impartial and confidential. We never charge people for advice and are for everyone regardless of background or circumstance. Social Security Scotland have 12 new benefits and we want to make sure everyone knows their rights of access them.â€

                        More than Â£600 million to support services.
                    

Additional funding of Â£8 million for overseas nurse recruitment and increased flexibility for Health Boards to retain staff are among new measures to support the health and care system through what is anticipated to be an extremely challenging winter.
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf has outlined a number of actions for the coming months backed by more than Â£600 million of funding.
Measures to support services include:
recruitment of 1,000 additional staff over the course of this winter, including Â£8 million to recruit up to 750 nurses, midwives and allied health professionals from overseas as well as 250 support staff across acute, primary care and mental health;
flexibility for Health Boards to offer â€˜pension recyclingâ€™, where unused employer contributions can be paid as additional salary, to support the retention of staff;
Â£45 million for the Scottish Ambulance Service to support on-going recruitment, service development and winter planning;
Â£124 million to assist health and social care partnerships expand care at home capacity; Â 
extension of the Social Care Staff Support Fund to 31 March 2023, to ensure staff receive full pay when in COVID isolation;
Writing to GPs to communicate the expectation that pre-bookable appointments are made available in every practice, alongside same day, face to face and remote appointments;
The first annual update has also been published on the NHS Recovery Plan which highlights significant progress made in the last year, including increasing NHS workforce to historically high levels, the success of the COVID vaccination programme, and a marked reduction in outpatient waits of over two years.
Mr Yousaf said:
â€œNHS Scotlandâ€™s staffing and funding is already at historically high levels, but as we approach the winter period it is crucial that we look to maximise, and enhance where we can, the capacity of the NHS. Given the scale of the escalating cost of living crisis, combined with the continued uncertainty posed by COVID and a possible resurgence of Flu, this winter will be one of the most challenging our NHS has ever faced.
â€œThese measures will support winter resilience across our health and care system, ensuring people get the right care they need at the right time and in the most appropriate setting. We will also expand our workforce, particularly registered nurses to assist with the expected increase in workload. We have jointly agreed a number of overarching priorities with Cosla which will help guide our services this winter. We are on course to double our virtual capacity this year and so far have avoided or saved bed days equivalent to adding a large district general hospital.
â€œWe have published the first update on our NHS Recovery Plan which highlights just how much progress we have made in the past year, I am determined to build on this and we will report on progress annually. Â 
â€œOur NHS and social care staff have shown remarkable resilience in the face of sustained pressure on services and I would like to thank them for their continued commitment and hard work. As we approach the Winter period their efforts will be vital in ensuring we deliver high quality care for the public.
â€œTo help relieve pressure on services, people should continue to consider whether their condition is an emergency before going to A&E. Local GPs and pharmacies can be contacted during the day for non-critical care, NHS 24 is also available on 111 for non-emergencies.â€

                        More than Â£300m payments made early to mitigate cost of living crisis.
                    

Payments to support Scottish farming businesses through the current financial crisis have exceeded targets by three months.
Payments have been issued to more than 14,200 businesses, totalling Â£328 million.
Sharp rises in energy, fuel and fertiliser costs for the agriculture sector prompted legislative changes to allow early payment of Scottish Government support schemes.
The legislative changes came into effect on 18 September and work to process payments began the next working day.
Rural Affairs Secretary Mairi Gougeon said: â€œI am acutely aware that businesses across Scotland are facing a hugely challenging increase in their bills and we have moved quickly to help relieve inflationary pressures and protect jobs across our world-leading food and drink sector.
â€œWe announced in June that farm payment dates would be brought forward to September in an effort to support Scotlandâ€™s farmers with cash flow and the cost of living crisis and we have delivered on our promise.
â€œThe first tranche of payments have substantially exceeded forecasts and are significantly ahead of previous years.â€
Annually, the Scottish Government pays out around Â£420 million through the Basic Payment Scheme and Greening payments.
This year, the Scottish Governmentâ€™s farm payment strategy will see a transition away from providing manual loan payments to automated scheme advance payments.

                        Bill to freeze rents and safeguard against evictions.
                    

Emergency legislation laid before the Scottish Parliament today seeks to increase protection for tenants from rent rises and eviction action during the cost of living crisis.
If approved, the Cost of Living (Tenant Protection) (Scotland) Bill will give Ministers temporary power to cap rents for private and social tenancies, with this cap set at 0% â€“ effectively freezing rents â€“ from 6 September 2022 until at least 31 March 2023. The Bill includes the further power to maintain or vary the rent cap over two further six-month periods.
Enforcement of eviction actions resulting from the cost crisis will be prevented over the same period except in a number of specified circumstances. Damages for unlawful evictions will be increased to a maximum of 36 monthsâ€™ worth of rent.
These measures will also apply to students in college or university halls of residence or other types of purpose-built accommodation.
The legislation includes safeguards for private sector landlords, allowing them to apply to increase rent to partially cover a limited number of specific costs including increased mortgage interest payments on the property they are letting, an increase in landlordsâ€™ insurance or increases in service charges paid as part of a tenancy, subject to an overall limit.
Safeguards for both social and private sector landlords, as well as providers of college and university halls and other purpose-built student accommodation, are included in the Billâ€™s provisions on evictions.
Tenantsâ€™ Rights Minister Patrick Harvie said:
â€œThe cost-of-living crisis is an emergency situation demanding an emergency response. Even as energy, food bills and other day-to-day basics become more expensive, todayâ€™s legislation freezing rents and protecting tenants from eviction will give tenants stability in their homes and confidence about their housing costs.
â€œPeople who rent their homes are more likely to live in poverty or be on low incomes than homeowners. As such they are particularly exposed to rising prices, and it is imperative that we bring in support for them urgently.
â€œWe know that many landlords have been doing what they can to protect their tenants, but some tenants are being hit with large rent increases that are hard to justify. This legislationÂ aims toÂ protect all tenants from substantial increases, balancing the protections that are urgently needed for tenants with safeguards for those landlords who may also be impacted by the cost crisis.â€
Background
The Cost of Living (Tenant Protection) (Scotland) Bill will be scrutinised and debated by MSPs this week.

Â 
Deputy First Minister John Swinney and his counterparts from other devolved governments are seeking an urgent meeting with Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng to discuss immediate actions needed to reverse the damaging effects of the UK Governmentâ€™s tax proposals.
Mr Swinney and the Finance Ministers from Wales and Northern Ireland are highlighting the profound impact of â€œthe largest set of unfunded tax cuts for the rich in over 50 yearsâ€ warning that it is â€œa huge gamble on public finances and the health of our economyâ€. Â 
In a joint letter to Mr Kwarteng, they warn against being condemned to another decade of austerity and express deep concern over reports that UK Government departments will be asked to make spending cuts to balance the budget, which may have profound consequences for devolved budget settlements already eroded by inflation.
The Ministers also renew calls for the UK Government to provide targeted support for households and businesses, funded through a windfall tax on the energy sector. In addition, they call for Social Security benefits to be increased, and request additional resources for the devolved governments to protect public services and to fund public sector pay settlements.

                        Leading economists to give expert advice.
                    

Members of an expert panel providing advice to the Scottish Government as part of its Emergency Budget Review (EBR) have been confirmed.
Sir Anton Muscatelli, Professor Frances Ruane and Professor Mike Brewer will assess the impact on Scotland of the UK Chancellorâ€™s fiscal approach and held their first meeting with Deputy First Minister John Swinney today.
Their advice will enable timely consideration of the implications of the UK Governmentâ€™s fiscal event as work continues to prioritise the Scottish Governmentâ€™s budget towards tackling the cost of living crisis. The Deputy First Minister has announced he will report the results of the EBR in the week beginning 24 October.
Mr Swinney said:
â€œThe Scottish Government wants to make sure it gets the very best advice and fresh perspectives as Ministers consider the complex and difficult decisions we face while tackling the challenges ahead.
â€œThe radical shift in UK economic policy announced by the Chancellor has already caused significant economic shock.
â€œFor the benefit of the people and businesses of Scotland, many of whom will find themselves paying higher prices as a result, it is vital that we consider the current situation and potential solutions with care.
â€œThe members of the panel all bring robust economic insight and I am grateful to them for giving their time and expertise as we navigate these uncharted economic waters.â€

                        New website provides â€˜one stop shopâ€™ for advice and information.
                    

A new website providing information on the wide range of advice and financial support available to people in Scotland has been launched.

Developed by the Scottish Government as a â€˜one stop shopâ€™ to help those struggling with the cost of living crisis, the website includes information on help available for households to meet rising energy, housing and other costs.

It also provides details on accessing Scottish and UK social security payments, including online benefit calculators, as well as wider health and wellbeing information.

A Programme for Government 2022-23 commitment, it will be supported by a nationwide media campaign to raise awareness of the website and signpost people impacted by rising costs to the help available.

The website was launched by Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison during a visit to debt help service in Tollcross, Edinburgh, run by charity Christians Against Poverty.

Shona Robison said:

â€œI know that people are struggling with the cost of living crisis right now and may not know where to turn for help. Our cost of living website is a trustworthy online resource with information on the wide range of vital support available.

â€œNo one should feel alone in this crisis and this website, along with our campaign, aims to encourage people to find out if they are eligible for the extensive support available to access the advice they need. We want everyone to get all the financial support and help that is available so I would encourage people to apply for the payments they are entitled to â€“ it might be just the lifeline that is needed right now.

â€œWe have allocated almost Â£3 billion in this financial year to contribute towards mitigating the increased cost of living crisis and the new website highlights the wide range of support at hand. Our package spans a range of support, for energy bills, childcare, health and travel, as well as social security payments that are not available anywhere else in the UK. The website is an important signpost towards them all.

â€œThe cost of living crisis is impacting every household in the UK and the Scottish Government will continue to do everything within its powers and finite budget to ensure people are supported as far as possible.â€

Scotland National Director for Christians Against Poverty, Emma Jackson, said: â€œWe are deeply concerned about the impact of rising costs on low income households. Even before rising costs, over a third (36%) of CAP clients had to borrow to meet essential living costs and we know the consequences of problem debt can be devastating for people.

â€œThe new cost of living website from the Scottish Government is a welcome step in helping people to find and access all the vital support that is available to them, including steps to maximise income. People need to know help is available. Now, more than ever, we need to take every action possible to support households who are being hit the hardest by the cost of living crisis.â€

Claire (not her real name) is a single parent from Edinburgh who experienced problem debt after her son was born prematurely. She spent a lot of time at the hospital and his health and wellbeing was her primary focus. Due to the stress of this situation she wasnâ€™t able to manage bills or work to earn money and debts began to mount.

Claireâ€™s debt had a significant impact on her mental health. She lived in fear of debt collectors coming to the door and hid the letters in a drawer as she didnâ€™t know how she would be able to pay them. She felt ashamed and embarrassed and for a long time she didnâ€™t know where to turn.

Problem debt had such an impact on Claireâ€™s mental health that she tried to take her own life twice. Claire heard about Christians Against Poverty through her local foodbank and once she met her debt coach she felt like a weight had been lifted and she was able to laugh again. She felt like CAP was her safe place and her befriender became like a mother to her.

Claire was able to go debt free in December 2021, however, she is still struggling on a low income. She already has to travel quite far to shop around and find the cheapest items. She is worried about how she will be able to keep going with rising costs.

She explained: â€œItâ€™s unbelievable what things cost at the moment, itâ€™s all gone up so much â€“ food, electric, clothes for my son. It all costs so much and right now, I just donâ€™t know how I am going to afford it all. Iâ€™ve worked hard to get back on track with my finances, but there isnâ€™t enough to pay for all of these essential things that I need for my son. I donâ€™t want to be in debt again.â€

The media campaign will run across TV, radio, outdoor and digital channels, encouraging people to visit the site for information on help and support available.

The Emergency Budget Review (EBR) will be informed by a panel of experts, including economists who will study the impact on Scotland of the UK Chancellorâ€™s fiscal approach.
Deputy First Minister John Swinney told the Scottish Parliament that further time was required to consider the implications of the UK Governmentâ€™s tax changes and he would report the results of the review in the week beginning 24 October.
The EBR will outline how resources will be redirected to tackle the cost of living crisis. In light of the UK Governmentâ€™s mini-budget last Friday and the significant economic instability which has followed, advice will be sought on the implications for Scotland.
Mr Swinney said:
â€œThe Chancellorâ€™s statement provided little respite for many families who are already facing a winter unable to afford essentials like food and heating. The UK Government needed to use its reserved powers to help those who need it most â€“ but instead we got tax cuts for the rich and not much for anyone else.
â€œThe Chancellor is taking a huge gamble on public finances and the health of our economy. And the markets have reacted strongly â€“ the pound fell to record lows on Monday, the cost of government borrowing has risen to its highest level in over a decade and investor confidence is plummeting.
â€œThe Scottish Government is doing everything within its powers to support people, public services and the economy but these efforts are under threat by the UK Governmentâ€™s new and dangerous race to the bottom. That is not a race we are willing to run. We will not be replicating the UK Governmentâ€™s tax cuts but will consider carefully the correct measures for Scotland.
â€œIt is vital that we give proper time to consider the serious implications for Scotland of the UK mini Budget before we conclude our Emergency Budget Review. I intend to seek advice from an expert panel and also to embark on discussions with businesses and trade unions. The Scottish Fiscal Commission will incorporate the impact of the changes in their next forecasts.â€

The Chancellorâ€™s fiscal statement and package of announcements targets the most wealthy, shifting further pressure onto the shoulders of those on the lowest incomes, Deputy First Minister John Swinney has said.
Reacting to the statement, Mr Swinney expressed his disappointment that while many households across Scotland are already struggling to pay their bills and heat their homes, the measures offer tax cuts for corporations and bankers.
The Deputy First Minister said:
â€œThe Chancellorâ€™s statement today will provide cold comfort to the millions of people across Scotland who have been looking for the UK Government to use its reserved powers to provide support for those that need it most. Instead we get tax cuts for the rich and little for those who need it most.
â€œWe estimate that the increase in the price cap to Â£2,500 will force an estimated 150,000 more Scottish households into extreme fuel poverty. Instead of offering these people support, the Chancellor is threatening to cut their family budgets further, with a new regime of benefit sanctions.
â€œOn Land and Buildings Transaction Tax and on Scottish income tax, the Scottish Government will set out its plans as part of the normal budget process. We will discuss the proposed investment zones with the UK Government but we are clear they have to be the right fit for Scotland.
â€œBecause of inflation, the Scottish Governmentâ€™s budget is worth Â£1.7 billion less than it was when we set it in December, yet the Chancellor has refused to provide a single additional penny for public services or increase public sector pay.
â€œWe are doing everything within our power to support people, public services and the economy, but these efforts are under threat by a reckless UK Government beginning a new, and dangerous race to the bottom. With a fixed Budget and no scope to borrow for short term challenges, Scotland is at the mercy of UK decisions. This reinforces the urgent need for independence.â€
Background:
A joint letter to the Chancellor from the Finance Ministers of the devolved governments urged the UK Government to better target support to those impacted the most by the cost of living crisis.            ",9/23/2022,Chancellorâ€™s measures fail to target support

                        Chancellor urged not to pass on costs to struggling households.
                    

The UK Government is being urged by the devolved governments to fund its cap on energy prices through a windfall tax, not higher borrowing.

In a joint letter to the new Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng, Deputy First Minister John Swinney is joined by Finance Ministers from Wales and Northern Ireland in calling for more targeted support to those impacted the most by the cost of living crisis.

They express their concern that more action is needed to prevent further hardship for households and businesses and say support â€œshould be funded by targeting the windfall gains in the energy sector rather than passing on the cost through higher borrowingâ€.

The Finance Ministers also call for additional funding to support vital public services in the face of rising prices, energy costs and wage pressures as devolved settlements are worth considerably less in real terms than last October when they were set.

The joint letter reads:

Dear Kwasi,

We want to jointly congratulate you on your new role as Chancellor of the Exchequer. We are committed to working constructively with you and the new UK Government. A productive working relationship will be essential to tackle the economic crisis facing our citizens, communities and businesses.

We wrote to your predecessor on 15 July outlining our considerable concerns with the worsening economic situation in the UK including the cost crisis, funding for public sector pay and the impact of inflation on the Devolved Governmentsâ€™ budgets. Our letter has been included as an annex here.

The Prime Ministerâ€™s announcement of 8 September limiting increases in energy bills will alleviate some of the anticipated additional pressures on households and businesses. However, it is important to recognise that overall this is an expensive package of measures that does not target support to those who need it most. We are deeply concerned at who will bear the brunt of these costs. Support should be funded by targeting the windfall gains in the energy sector rather than passing the cost to households through higher borrowing. 

Looking ahead to your forthcoming fiscal statement, we urge you to focus efforts on those most impacted, not just relying on blanket interventions which do not recognise the scale of hardship particular households are facing.Â  An extended and targeted support package needs to be provided to help those who, even with the cap, are facing the impossible choice between heating their homes and feeding themselves and their loved ones. Even with the price cap, energy costs are still double what they were last year.

In addition to households, early clarity and additional support is also required for businesses and the third sector, who are facing substantial challenges. The current measures provide businesses with only a temporary respite and little certainty to help them plan for the future. Many organisations would be forced to close if they are not supported. 

Ministers in the Devolved Governments have exhausted the options available to us to address the cost crisis, stretching every pound available to us to provide support. The main levers that can make a difference are held by the UK Government and it must now take urgent steps to use these to provide much needed certainty to those suffering hardship and poverty.

The crisis has also resulted in a major squeeze on funding for public services and increases in demand. Additional funding is urgently needed to support our vital public services in the face of rising prices, energy costs and wage pressures, alongside unforeseen pressures. Based on recent inflation and widespread inflationary expectations for the next year or two, our respective three-year spending review settlements are worth considerably, potentially billions, less in real terms than when we received them last October. 

Further, Russiaâ€™s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has resulted in many Ukrainians seeking safety across the UK, however it is necessary to increase the funding available to support them here. In particular, there is a lack of parity in the funding available for those arriving under the Ukraine Family Scheme and the Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme, which cannot be right. â€˜Thank You Paymentsâ€™ to host families should also, in line with Lord Harringtonâ€™s recommendation, be doubled to ensure that those who have opened their homes to Ukrainians do not lose out financially as a result.

We would welcome early engagement and clarity on planned fiscal events to enable us to set out the implications for the devolved nations and effectively plan our own budgets, which are significantly impacted by UK spending and tax decisions.

Collaborative working between the UK Government and the Devolved Governments in a spirit of mutual respect would be of benefit to all of us.

Given that, now overdue, action is required to tackle the crisis we propose a quadrilateral meeting with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury as soon as possible and in advance of the FISC to agree the immediate steps that must be taken to tackle this issue and support households, businesses and the public sector. 

This letter has been copied to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and the Secretaries of State for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Yours sincerely,Â

Â 
Around Â£500 million in savings have been found as resources are focused on tackling the â€œharsh realityâ€ of the cost of living crisis, Deputy First Minister John Swinney has said.
He updated the Scottish Parliament on steps being taken to meet the increased costs of public sector pay and to provide support to those who need it most, while balancing public finances.
Soaring inflation means the Scottish Governmentâ€™s budget is now worth Â£1.7 billion less in real terms than it was last December. Since then inflation has risen from around 4% to more than 10% â€“ with possible further increases when figures come out next week.
Mr Swinney set out to Parliament where savings have so far been made to help pay for initiatives such as fair public sector pay settlements and doubling the Fuel Insecurity Fund. He has also written to the Finance and Public Administration Committee outlining the details of reductions in planned spending made in recent weeks.
The Deputy First Minister has committed to setting out the Emergency Budget Review within two weeks of the UK Government budget update expected later this month. He warned further intervention will represent a significant challenge given the largely fixed Scottish Government budget and limited fiscal powers.
Mr Swinney said:
â€œOur budget was based on a UK Spending Review that simply did not foresee the levels of inflation that are now a reality.
â€œThat alone would require the budget to be revisited. Â But in times of crisis the job of the finance secretary is not simply to balance the books. It is to find the money to help families, to back business and to fund the priority projects that improve lives for the long term. And so, the Emergency Budget Review must both identify funding to cope with inflation-driven cost increases and aim to support those who most need our help during this crisis.
â€œThis is the harsh reality of a fixed budget and limited powers. The Scottish Government simply does not have access to many of the levers which would provide the greatest support in this crisis. We will do everything we can. We will make the hard choices. But only the UK Government can act to end this crisis. They should do so â€“ and I encourage them to do so now.â€

A combined rent freeze and moratorium on evictions to help people through the cost crisis has been announced as the centrepiece of the 2022-23 Programme for Government (PfG).
The programme outlines emergency legislation which will be introduced to put in place a rent freeze until at least 31 March 2023 and a moratorium on evictions, as well asÂ a new tenantsâ€™ rights campaign. In addition a â€˜one-stop-shopâ€™ website will be introduced to provideÂ peopleÂ with information on the range of benefits and support available to help them through the current cost of living crisis.
With Â£3 billion allocated to the end of March for a range of support that will help mitigate the impact of the cost crisis on households, the PfG also confirms the Scottish Child Payment will increase to Â£25 per week per eligible child from 14 November when it also opens to all under 16s.
In addition, the programme includes the roll out of free school meals across all primary school age groups, doubles the Fuel Insecurity Fund to Â£20 million to help households at risk of self-disconnection or self-rationing of energy, confirms rail fares will be frozen until March 2023 and widens the Warmer Homes Fuel Poverty Programme.
For businesses â€“ in addition to an existing package of financial aid worth over Â£800 million â€“ six ground-breaking â€˜tech scalersâ€™ will be opened, two job-boosting Greenports progressed and the National Strategy for Economic Transformation focussing on economy supporting measures continued.
In total, the PfG sets out 18 new Bills including legislation on an independence referendum and major reforms in the justice system, including a Criminal Justice Reform Bill that will propose the end of the Not Proven verdict in Scots Law and provide anonymity for complainers in sexual offence cases. Â A Bill for the creation of the new National Care Service will also go through parliament this year.
The programme also builds on long-term commitments made in the Bute House Agreement and restates Ministersâ€™ commitment to the importance of delivering on Scotlandâ€™s climate ambitions. These range from a consultation on legislation to transform how buildings are heated to continuing record investment in active travel.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:
â€œThis Programme for Government is published in the context of the most severe cost crisis in many of our lifetimes. It is a crisis pushing millions into poverty and poses a genuine danger, not just to livelihoods, but to lives.
â€œThe Scottish Government is already committed to a range of measures, worth almost Â£3 billion this year, that will help with rising costs. But the magnitude of what is being experienced by people and businesses means that mitigation is nowhere near sufficient. What is needed now is action on a scale similar to the initial Covid response.
â€œRegrettably, the powers to act in the manner and on the scale needed do not lie with this Parliament. In my view, they should lie here. If they did, we could have acted already. But they donâ€™t. These powers are reserved to Westminster.
â€œThe cost crisis means this Programme for Government is more focussed than ever before â€“ deliberately so â€“ with priority actions to provide help now.
â€œTo that end we will provide more help for people who may be at risk of self-rationing or even self-disconnection from their energy supply and we will double the Fuel Insecurity Fund to Â£20 million this year.
â€œWe will also propose emergency legislation to put in place a rent freeze until at least March and a moratorium on evictions.
â€œGiven the powers to act in the manner and on the scale needed do not lie with this Parliament, this Programme for Government also provides for a Scottish Independence Referendum Bill. Independence would give us â€“ like it does other independent countries â€“ the levers we desperately need to respond to a crisis such as this. Thatâ€™s the prize we surely must grasp.â€

                        Funding package to improve island infrastructure.
                    

Six island local authorities will receive a share of Â£4.45 million to assist critical projects on climate change, population retention and tourism.
A total of 11 projects, spread across 31 islands, have received funding for the current financial year as part of the Islands Programme.
Projects include a new visitor centre and EV charging points at Old Man of Storr, nine â€˜Island Pit Stopsâ€™ at Arran and Cumbrae providing better facilities for visitors, a new nursery at Kirkwall to replace an existing building earmarked for demolition and improvement of critical sea front infrastructure at Tobermory.
Announcing the funding during her visit to Orkney, Islands Secretary Mairi Gougeon said:
â€œThis is an important investment especially given the consequences of the cost of living crisis and climate change which are of particular concern for our islands. This investment will go some way in helping us support our island communities.
â€œI am happy to be here in Orkney, to announce the allocation of Â£1.5 million to the Orkney Islands Council for a brand new nursery facility. The new nursery will support families from both mainland Orkney and the outer isles, as well as providing opportunities for Childhood Practice Students from Orkney College.Â 
â€œI wish all the successful projects the very best and look forward to following their progress.â€
Scottish Futures Trust is providing support and feedback for the projects. The funding is part of the Islands Programme, which supports the implementation of the 2019 National Islands Plan, helping to make the Scottish islands even better places to live, study, work and raise a family.
Councillor Gwenda Shearer Chair of Orkney Islands Councilâ€™s Education, Leisure and Housing Committee said:
â€œThe funding allocation for the new nursery facility is fantastic news. The stated purpose of the fund is to improve quality of life in our island areas â€“ and improved access to child care facilities for our local families really does tick that box.Â 
â€œThe new facility will make an enormous difference locally and we are looking forward to progressing the project.â€
Tony Rose, Director for Strategy, Scottish Futures Trust said:Â 
â€œOur infrastructure experts have been working with Scottish Government and the six island local authorities to ensure the Islands Programme delivers positive outcomes for island communities.
â€œThis funding will now be invested in much-needed community infrastructure such as a low carbon childrenâ€™s nursery and a circular economy social enterprise venture, that will support repopulation, economic growth and local jobs. Our focus now is on working with the successful applicants to see their projects come to fruition and achieve what the communities need.â€
BACKGROUND:
The 2022/23 Islands Programme (IP) was launched on 21 March 2022, with an application deadline of 10 June 2022.Â  It is being delivered in partnership with local government via a competitive bid process with the six island Local Authorities as lead applicants.
Applications to the IP have been subject to scrutiny and assessment by the Islands Programme Investment Panel which has made recommendations on projects to be funded.Â  The panel is selected from Scottish Government and a range of partner organisations who have experience of panel assessments and infrastructure spending.

Detail of Approved Projects 
Argyll and Bute Council
Island Community Halls Digital Hubs, Â£100,000. Coll, Iona, Islay, Tiree. Argyll and Bute Council.
This project will create four digital hubs in island community halls for a variety of uses including hybrid meetings, access for online services and NHS â€œNear Meâ€ clinics.Â  It will act as a pathfinder for other potential sites across other islands and build on experiences from the pandemic to provide inclusive digital access and a reduction in travelling time, costs and emissions.
Tobermory Seawall and Railings Improvements, Â£250,000. Mull.
This project will provide critical sea front infrastructure to the community of Tobermory by adding resilience against tidal surges and helping to reduce the impact of climate change. The work will also support the sustainability of existing businesses and provide a safer and more welcoming environment.
Comhairle nan Eilean Siar
Ionad Hiort â€“ RIBA Stage 4 design fees, Â£167,000. Lewis. Comhairle nan Eilean Siar.
The Ionad Hiort/ St Kilda Centre project aims to build a Â£6.25m visitor centre in Uig in the Isle of Lewis.Â  This application is for RIBA stage 4 work which will provide the necessary detailed specifications to progress to the tender stage.Â  Ionad Hiort has been recognized by the UNESCO World Heritage Centre as a global exemplar for remote access to the hundreds of World Heritage Sites where visitor access in large numbers is either impossible or undesirable. The project aims to provide critical employment thereby supporting retention and growth in population and will contribute to re-invigorating a living Gaidhlig community.
Community Facilities Programme â€“ Uist, Â£347,781. Berneray, North Uist, Eriskay.
The Community Facilities Regeneration Programme is a series of three regeneration projects for a community hall; reconfiguring a building into a digital co-working space and safeguarding another community building prior to establishing a community hub. The programme will have significant impacts in future proofing each groupâ€™s facilities while increasing the level of service provision. The energy efficiency measures taken with incorporation of Renewable Energy solutions will lead to a dramatic reduction annually in carbon emissions across the three projects.
The Highland Council 
Old Surgery Housing Enablement, Â£72,000. Eigg.
This project will deliver the enabling ground works, bore hole and electricity connections in preparation for the main construction phase of two new homes in as timely a manner as possible.Â  This project has strong links to population retention and growth, housing and will use off grid and renewable energy connections. The application is focused solely on infrastructure to â€œunlockâ€ the site, comprising a new, robust water supply and establishing an electrical connection to Eigg Electric Ltd (Eiggâ€™s Green Energy Grid).
The Old Man of Storr, Â£440,000. Skye.
The ambition of the overall project is to deliver a world class experience for visitors to the Old Man of Storr that showcases Skyeâ€™s unique heritage and culture. This application is focused on the provision of a retail/visitor unit on-site and EV charging points.Â  There are strong links with sustainability, education, and sustainable economic development in addition to increased awareness of Gaelic and local culture.
North Ayrshire Council
Regeneration of Millport Town Hall â€“ phase 2, Â£509,450. Cumbrae.
Phase 2 of a multi-funded development to use the buildingâ€™s basement to provide a central community space, delivering a package of activities and attractions within a heritage building. The renovated space will provide additional operational income to sustain the project and extend options for use. The project has high levels of community involvement, partnership working and builds on previous investment. Natural light, solar panels and air source heat pumps will provide a significant amount of the buildingâ€™s energy and LED lighting. New conservation standard double-glazed windows and insulation will be installed.
Island Pit Stops, Â£540,000. Arran and Cumbrae.
This project seeks to manage the challenges of increased visitor numbers by re-purposing and improving existing infrastructure to encourage visitor dispersal and cope with over-visitation at key sites. It aims to increase the quality of the visitorsâ€™ experience by providing better facilities, thereby supporting increased dwell time and spend on the islands. Island toilet buildings will be redeveloped into accessible and eco designed Island Pit stops across nine locations.Â  This project provides a replicable example of sustainable tourism.
Orkney Islands Council 
New Kirkwall Nursery, Â£1,500,000. Mainland Orkney.
New build nursery facility located next to Orkney College campus, to replace an existing building earmarked for demolition and which is the only current nursery facility in Orkney.Â  The project has strong links to population retention, addressing child poverty and meeting net zero ambitions.Â  The proposed nursery is located adjacent to Orkney College, leading to opportunities to support Childhood Practice Students as they develop their skills, therefore supporting a key sector which has had recruitment challenges. The new-build facility will save approx. 20 tonnes of CO2 in moving the nursery service from the old 1960 CLASP building to the new highly insulated building.
Shetland Islands Council
Aald Skul Enterprise Development Â£88,095. Mainland Shetland.
By investing in a new portable cabin, additional access and parking, this social enterprise in a small community will be able to expand the range and volume of repaired, donated items offered for sale. This project is a strong replicable example of working towards net zero ambitions in a remote community and is a clear model of the circular economy in action. The Scrapstore strives to meet net zero ambitions through reducing travel and energy associated with disposing of goods which are still in good/repairable condition or with travelling to buy new items.Â  This can help to reduce overall household expenses, and influence perception that the community can be an affordable place to live in comparison to other areas and centres.
Papa Stour Kirk Development Â£252,505.Â  Papa Stour. Shetland Islands Council.
This second phase of a three-phase project will help safeguard and improve the building fabric of Papa Stour Kirk, the only community facility on the island.Â  The work will protect the building for continued use and provide a stepping stone ultimately to a new community hub and visitor centre.Â  There are strong links to supporting NIP Strategic Objective 10 empowered local communities and incorporates net zero ambitions.

                        Cost crisis high on the agenda.
                    

A new group established to help Scotlandâ€™s retail sector as it recovers from the pandemic has discussed soaring energy costs and the impact of Brexit.
At its first meeting, the Retail Industry Leadership Group (RILG) also considered how to deliver the Scottish Governmentâ€™s Retail Strategy and began drafting priorities to help businesses grow.
The Group is co-chaired by the Minister for Public Finance, Planning and Community Wealth Tom Arthur and the Chief Operating Officer of the John Lewis Partnership, Andrew Murphy. It comprises senior business representatives, trades unions and industry groups.
It will work with the Scottish Government to help the retail sector meet current and longer term challenges while becoming stronger and more resilient. Fair Work and achieving Net Zero goals will underpin the groupâ€™s work.
Mr Arthur said:
â€œThis first meeting of the Retail Industry Leadership Group was timely given the cost crisis we are facing and allowed us to learn more about the impact on retail businesses, staff and customers. Implementing the Retail Strategy can help the sector seize opportunities, deal with longer term trends, and recover from immediate challenges.
â€œThere is no single solution to helping retailers so, as we approach a challenging winter, it is essential the response from government at every level happens at speed, to address the nature and magnitude of the emergency. We support calls from businesses for measures related to energy prices, VAT reduction, staff shortages and handling business loans - direct support which falls within the reserved responsibilities of the UK Government.â€
Co-chair and Chief Operating Officer of the John Lewis Partnership, Andrew Murphy said:
""I was encouraged by the positive and collaborativeÂ nature of our discussion. Given the scale and nature of the collective challenges we are all facing, this is both timely and vital.
â€œThere was a shared concern around the impact inflation is having on suppliers, employees, customers and our communities through the current cost of living crisis.Â It is clear that both retailers and the Scottish Government continue to work hard to find ways to provide more support where they can.
""I'm excited by the evident enthusiasm of the Leadership Group to drive forward the implementation of the Retail Strategy. Fair Work, the skills agenda and the importance of retail in delivering high quality town and city centres are uppermost in our minds as we look ahead to the next few months.""
Background
The Scottish Government Resilience committee (SGoRR) is meeting weekly to consider the cost crisis. The action being taken by the Scottish Government was set out by the First Ministerâ€™s statement on 11 August.
Establishing an Industry Leadership Group was a key action in the Scottish Governmentâ€™s Retail Strategy to promote recovery. Read more on Getting the Right Change: A Retail Strategy for Scotland.
The Group will also focus on encouraging retail businesses to demonstrate their commitment to Fair Work principles; harnessing opportunities in the National Strategy for Economic Transformation that will directly support the retail sector; making the sector responsive to changing consumer behaviours; overseeing development of a Skills Audit and Action Plan; and developing a Just Transition Plan to guide retail towards Net Zero.

                        Â£1.2 million to ensure households and businesses get support.
                    

Immediate funding is being awarded to key energy advice organisations to make sure energy customers can access crucial support and advice to deal with rising energy bills and heating costs.
More than Â£1.2 million will be distributed to help key agencies, including Advice Direct Scotland, Home Energy Scotland and Citizenâ€™s Advice Scotland, reach more people who need help.
The funding will also support a training programme for staff from third sector organisations to expand the reach of expert advice.
The Scottish Government committed to providing additional support to advice agencies at the Scottish Energy Summit hosted by the First Minister on Tuesday 23 August, at which a series of further actions to mitigate the energy price rises were agreed with energy companies and advice organisations.
The additional funding announced today is on top of the Scottish Governmentâ€™s existing investment in free income, welfare and debt advice services, including support to Money Advice Scotland and the Welfare Advice and Health Partnerships Programme.
Minister for Zero Carbon Buildings and Tenants Rights Patrick Harvie visited Home Energy Scotlandâ€™s Edinburgh offices to speak to advisors who have been supporting households.
Mr Harvie said:
â€œWe know that this is an incredibly unsettling time for all households and businesses and it is imperative that those worried about or struggling with heating their homes access the information and support they need to reduce their energy bills.
â€œA further energy price cap increase announcement will only serve to escalate concerns, making the need for impartial, expert advice and support even more vital.
â€œThe Scottish Government is clear that energy customers simply cannot be expected to carry the burden of further price rises in October, and that the UK Government must now commit to freeze the cap for all households and to support energy companies to deliver that.
â€œIn the meantime, the cost crisis is already hitting energy customers hard and the Scottish Government will continue to do everything within our means to support the people of Scotland through it.
â€œThis funding will ensure that expert advisors across the country stand ready to provide crucial support and guidance to those understandably worried about their energy bills. I would urge everyone who has concerns to access these services and get the support they need.â€
Background
A total of Â£1.268 million will be distributed across energy advice services as follows:
Â£220,000 to Advice Direct Scotland to fund new staff in its contact centres for consumers, including vulnerable consumers, in need of help.
Â£50,000 to Advice Direct Scotland to create a user-friendly online digital journey for customers
Â£220,000 to Citizenâ€™s Advice Scotland to enhance capacity in their local advice bureaus enabling them to provide advice on both energy debt and energy efficiency measures.
Â£280,000 to expand the Home Energy Scotland advice Service
Â£198,000 for Home Energy Scotland recruits who will provide training to staff from third sector organisations on energy efficiency, which will see around 200 local community groups and organisations benefit
Â£300,000 to enhance support for businesses through Business Energy Scotland
The Scottish Government estimates that 906,000 or 36% of all households will be in fuel poverty in October 2022, based on an Ofgem price cap of Â£2,800 and taking into account previously announced government mitigations.
The Scottish Government has allocated almost Â£3 billion in this financial year that will help households face the increased cost of living. This includes the provision of services and financial support not available elsewhere in the UK that is helping to reduce everyday costs and increase incomes.
It also includes Â£10 million to continue the Fuel Insecurity Fund which helps households at risk of severely rationing their energy use, or self-disconnecting entirely. This includes direct support for households using any tariff or fuel type, and is delivered via trusted third sector partners the Fuel Bank Foundation, Advice Direct Scotland and the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations.

                        Marking one year of the Bute House Agreement.
                    

New funding has been announced to cut carbon emissions in homes and commercial properties, as the Scottish Government continues to focus on delivering its net zero targets and support families with the cost of living.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Zero Carbon Buildings Minister Patrick Harvie announced Â£16.2 million funding for five zero emission heat networks during a visit to ng Homes in Glasgow.
The announcement coincides with the first anniversary of the Scottish Government and the Scottish Green Party Parliamentary Group signing the Bute House Agreement, a plan to work together to build a green economic recovery from COVID, respond to the climate emergency and create a fairer country.
In its first year the agreement has delivered a range of benefits for households, communities and businesses and seen work begin on a number of longer-term reforms.
Particular progress has been made across a range of areas including:
Doubling the Scottish Child Payment to Â£20 per week per eligible child from April 2022, with plans to extend eligibility to under 16s and further increasing the payment to Â£25 per week by the end of 2022.
Bringing ScotRail into public ownership.
Introducing free bus travel for under 22s to cut the cost of living for young people, encourage sustainable travel behaviours early in their lives and improve access to education, leisure, and work.
Investing a record Â£150 million in active travel in 2022-23, including more than doubling the funding for the National Cycle Network, a new walking fund, and supporting pilots for free bikes for school age children who cannot afford them.
Publishing Scotland's National Strategy for Economic Transformation setting out how Scotland will transition to a wellbeing economy.
The Agreement set out a strategy for over a million homes to be using zero carbon heating systems by the end of the decade and allocating funds from a total planned investment of Â£1.8 billion to cut energy bills, improved building energy efficiency and reduce climate emissions.
Scotlandâ€™s Heat Network Fund offers long term funding support to deliver more climate-friendly ways of heating Scotlandâ€™s homes and buildings. It has enabled the rollout of new zero emission heat networks and communal heating systems, as well as the expansion and decarbonisation of existing heat networks across Scotland.
Moving forward, the Scottish Government is primarily focused on four key tasks: reducing child poverty; addressing the climate crisis; the recovery from COVID of Scotlandâ€™s public services including the delivery of the National Strategy for Economic Transformation; and the development of the prospectus for an independent Scotland and an independence referendum in October 2023.Â 
The First Minister said:
â€œThe world has changed substantially since the Agreement was reached 12 months ago. The conflict in Ukraine and the rising cost of living crisis have profoundly impacted everyoneâ€™s lives.
â€œHowever, the stable and collaborative government provided by the Agreement, has helped to deliver immediate action in the face of these challenges, including supporting those displaced from Ukraine and using the powers that Ministers have to address the cost of living crisis.
â€œAction is needed now to support communities to respond to the cost of living and climate crises, and Scotlandâ€™s Heat Network Fund is just one of the many initiatives that the Scottish Government has already undertaken. The projects that receive support from the Fund will fully align with the Scottish Governmentâ€™s aim to eradicate fuel poverty by supplying heat at affordable prices to consumers, which is especially important now when we are seeing record rises in the cost of heating.
â€œThe Bute House Agreement was reached to equip us best to deal with the challenges we face, because we believe that new ideas and ways of working are required to deal with new problems. An unstable world needs more co-operation and more constructive working towards building a consensus, if governments are to be equal to what the people need of them.â€
Mr Harvie said:
â€œOne year on from the Scottish Greens entering government as part of the Bute House Agreement, I am proud of what this Government is doing to build a fairer, greener Scotland. From free bus transport for young people to doubling the Scottish Child Payment, we are committed to accelerating action to tackle the climate and cost of living crises.
â€œThe energy crisis households across Scotland now face is being driven by rocketing prices for gas, which we depend on for heat. We are clear that we need to redouble our efforts to improve the efficiency of our homes, making them more comfortable and cheaper to run, and end our reliance on gas for heat. Thatâ€™s why we are investing Â£1.8 billion in our green homes and buildings programme.
â€œDelivering a just transition to net-zero and seizing the opportunities this presents is a major focus of the Scottish Government, and rapidly increasing Scotlandâ€™s renewable energy generating capacity and securing accompanying jobs and investment will be central to our work over the rest of the parliament.
â€œDuring the first year of the Agreement firm foundations have been built, demonstrating delivery and progress on shared policy priorities and adopting an approach that is both challenging and constructive.â€

                        First Minister to convene roundtable on the growing cost emergency.
                    

The First Minister will convene an urgent summit with energy supply companies and consumer groups later this month, to discuss how advice and support for people struggling with energy bills can be improved.
The summit will consider what collective action can be taken by government, energy companies and the third sector to help businesses and consumers access advice, and get support with debt issues.
Scotlandâ€™s major energy suppliers including Scottish Power, OVO Energy, Centrica, Octopus and E.ON, as well as industry bodies and key consumer and poverty organisations will attend.
The summit follows last weekâ€™s meeting of the Scottish Government Resilience Committee on the cost living crisis and will take place ahead of OfGemâ€™s next energy price cap announcement on 26 August.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:
â€œI know that this is an incredibly unsettling time for households and energy consumers across Scotland and the Scottish Government will continue to do everything we can to support those affected.
â€œThere is a not a single solution to this problem and government, industry and the third sector in Scotland needs to work collaboratively together to ensure the right support is in place for householders and businesses during this challenging winter. This could include improving the availability of help and advice and considering a more compassionate approach to debt management.
â€œHowever, it remains the case that the powers and resources needed to tackle this emergency on the scale required - access to borrowing, welfare, VAT on fuel, taxation of windfall profits, regulation of the energy market - lie with the UK Government. Only the UK Government can access and make available resources on the scale required. They need to take action, now.
â€œAs I said last week, a first step would be to cancel the energy price cap rise this autumn.â€
Peter Kelly, Director, The Poverty Alliance said:
â€œWe are pleased that the First Minister will be convening this summit of energy companies, along with the Poverty Alliance and Energy Action Scotland.
â€œAcross the country, people are increasingly being swept up amid a rising tide of hardship. But with the energy price cap due to increase in October, that tide threatens to become a flood.
â€œHouseholds up and down Scotland are terrified of what the colder months will bring and the likelihood is that - without further action - lives and life chances will be at risk. The situation could scarcely be more urgent.
â€œBut it is a situation we can do something about, by taking action to protect people most at risk of poverty and deeper hardship. It is that much-needed and urgent action that we are hoping the summit can bring about.â€
Frazer Scott, CEO of Energy Action Scotland said:
â€œWith our colleagues at the Poverty Alliance, we welcome the First Ministerâ€™s intervention in gathering energy companies together to talk about how we can best support households struggling to afford spiralling energy bills.
â€œFuel poverty will affect over one million Scottish households this winter requiring urgent intervention focussed on targeting those most in need.
â€œCold, damp homes affect health and wellbeing and will put thousands of lives at risk as well as adding additional pressure to the NHS, making this a vital intervention for Scotland.â€

                        Legal right to access free period products in Scotland.
                    

Scotland is to become the first country in the world to protect in law the right to access free period products.
Councils and education providers will be legally required to make period products available free of charge to anyone who needs them when the Period Products (Free Provision) (Scotland) Act comes into force tomorrow (Monday 15 August).
Since 2017, the Scottish Government has invested more than Â£27 million to fund access in a range of public settings and the new law will cement this progress.
Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison said:
â€œProviding access to free period products is fundamental to equality and dignity, and removes the financial barriers to accessing them. This is more important than ever at a time when people are making difficult choices due to the cost of living crisis and we never want anyone to be in a position where they cannot access period products.
â€œSince 2018, we have delivered ground-breaking action by providing free period products for pupils and students in all our schools, colleges and universities. We are proud to be the first national government in the world to take such action.
â€œThe work we are doing in Scotland continues to be world leading, going goes beyond provision of free products. We have also provided funding for an educational website for employers, run a successful anti-stigma campaign, and improved menstrual health resources available for schools.
â€œIâ€™m grateful to all the young women and girls who have been crucial in developing the best ways to access products to meet their needs.â€
People can find their nearest collection point through the PickupMyPeriod mobile app which was launched earlier this year by social enterprise Hey Girls with Scottish Government support.
Celia Hodson, founder of Hey Girls, said:
â€œThe Period Product Act shows Scotland is leading the way in recognising that period products are not a luxury and should be freely available to all.
â€œThrough our PickupMyPeriod app, we work to ensure no-one in Scotland is left without access to period products and are well on the way to achieving that with more than 1,000 locations highlighted to users.
â€œWe hope the Act will help those in need and that our app will be of support to many more as our network continues to grow.â€
Background
The main duties on local authorities and education providers in the Period Products (Free Provision) (Scotland) Act 2021 will come into effect on 15 August 2022. In October 2021 the Scottish Government published guidance to support organisations in delivering these products.
The Act builds on the Period Products in Schools (Scotland) Regulations which came into force in October 2020, placing a duty on local authorities and grant-aided schools to provide free products for pupils. The Scottish Government is providing Â£3.4 million in 2022-23 for access to free period products for students.
Scotlandâ€™s approach to delivering period dignity has been commended globally, with countries including South Korea and New Zealand taking a similar approach to meet their own needs.            ",8/14/2022,Period Products Act comes into force

                        Scottish Government Resilience Room convened.
                    

The First Minister has chaired the Scottish Government Resilience Committee (August 11) to discuss urgent steps to mitigate the growing cost emergency which is affecting people and businesses.

Ministers assessed the current situation and likely scenarios in the months ahead and agreed a number of immediate actions. The Scottish Government will:

Continue to maximise the direct financial assistance available to those most in need, principally through ongoing work to extend eligibility for and increase the value of the Scottish Child Payment
 Undertake an emergency budget review to assess any and all opportunities to redirect additional resources to those most in need, reduce the burdens on business and stimulate the Scottish economy
 Consider urgently all options within devolved powers for regulatory action to limit increases in costs for people, businesses and other organisations
 Bring togetherÂ energy companies, banks and food retailers to examine what further help can be provided by these businesses to limit cost increases and protect those most vulnerableÂ 
 Work with partners to strengthen the safety net of emergency food/fuel provision, prioritising a 'cash first' approach
 Provide further advice to households on using energy more efficiently and reducing consumption
The Resilience Committee will meet on a weekly basis for the foreseeable future to oversee and direct progress on these immediate actions and keep under ongoing review any further steps that the Scottish Government can take.

In addition to doing everything possible within its powers, the Scottish Government is renewing its call for urgent and substantial action from the UK Government including:

An immediate doubling of the direct financial support already provided, with payments made by October. It is estimated that for an out-of-work couple with two children, the payments already announced by the UK Government fall around Â£1,600 short of meeting the recent changes to benefits and living costs â€“ a gap that must be filled
 Cancellation of the forthcoming increase in the energy price cap, followed by urgent work between the government and energy companies on energy market reforms and associated financing options to ensure sustainable costs for consumers in the long term
 The urgent introduction of an energy price cap for Small and Medium Enterprises
 Support for business to prevent closures due to energy price rises and investment in economic stimulus to minimise the scale of the projected recession
 A further windfall tax to ensure nationalisation of the profits being made out of the current pressures
 Additional funding to support public sector pay increases and protect the recovery of public services from the pandemic
The First Minister said:

â€œIt is clear that the UK currently faces a rapidly escalating emergency that goes beyond simply the cost of living and is now a more general cost of everything crisis. This emergency may be of a different nature to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it is on a similar scale.

â€œIn the absence of substantial and urgent action, this emergency will cause acute deprivation and suffering. It will affect access to practical necessities for millions of people across the UK. Bluntly, it will cost lives.

â€œTo illustrate the severity of the situation, the Scottish Government estimates that, even with current UK Government mitigations, at least 700,000 households in Scotland - 30% of all households - will be living in extreme fuel poverty by October. That number could be even higher, if the Ofgem price cap for October 2022 is above Â£2,800.Â 

â€œIt is essential, therefore, that the response from government at every level is commensurate, in scale and speed, to the nature and magnitude of the emergency.

â€œIn developing a response, governments must first and foremost address immediate need. We must all focus on supporting individuals, businesses and jobs by addressing the principal root causes of the problem.

â€œScottish Ministers are clear that the powers and resources needed to tackle this emergency on the scale required - access to borrowing, welfare, VAT on fuel, taxation of windfall profits, regulation of the energy market - lie with the UK Government. This is reflected in the actions we have proposed and set out today.

â€œAt the same time, the Scottish Government will continue to do everything within our resources and powers to help those most affected.â€            ",8/11/2022,Taking action on cost emergency

Cost of living crisis:Â find out what help is available



The First Minister has sought an emergency meeting of the Prime Minister and Heads of devolved Government Council to agree steps to help people in need as a result of the cost of living crisis.

In a letter to the Prime Minister urging the suggested September meeting be brought forward due to a â€œfast deterioratingâ€ situation the First Minister made her view clear that â€œmany people across the UK simply cannot afford to wait until September for further action to be takenâ€.

The meeting between leaders of the devolved governments and the UK Government would provide an opportunity to agree actions that can be taken now and formulate a plan of action for the long term.Â 

The Scottish Government Resilience Room (SGoRR) will convene this week to discuss what steps can be taken to urgently ease the burden on households across Scotland, both now and in the future.

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:

â€œWhile we will continue to take all actions available to us within devolved responsibilities and budgets - the Scottish Government is investing almost Â£3 billion this year in a range of measures which will help address the cost of living pressures - it is a statement of fact that many of the levers which would make the biggest difference lie with the UK Government.

â€œIt is also the case that only the UK Government can access and make available resources on the scale required. Therefore, actions by devolved governments alone - though importantÂ  - will not be enough to meet the unprecedented challenges we face.Â Â 

â€œAction is needed now to address significant gaps in help for households, in particular those on low incomes, who are increasingly vulnerable to the impact of rising household costs.

â€œHowever, it is also vital, given further increases to energy bills due to be announced later this month, that a substantial plan be developed now to avert and mitigate what will otherwise be a crisis of unprecedented proportions - a crisis in which many people will be unable to feed themselves and their families or heat their homes.Â Â Â 

â€œWhile few will escape some impact of the cost of living crisis, these impacts are not being experienced evenly. That is why the focus must be on providing targeted support to those most adversely impacted, rather than an irresponsible reduction in broad-based taxes which will benefit the relatively better off over those most in need.

â€œThe current crisis requires clear, focused and determined leadership and co-operation to develop and deliver - at pace - a package of interventions to protect those most impacted.""

The UK Government has been urged to provide additional funding for public sector pay deals or the Scottish Government may be unable to fund equivalent offers without cuts to public services, according to Deputy First Minister John Swinney.
In a letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nadhim Zahawi, Mr Swinney outlines concerns that last yearâ€™s UK Spending Review, which determined the majority of the current Scottish Budget, did not take into account the level of pay increase recently proposed by the independent pay review bodies.
Mr Swinney also warned that the UK Spending Review did not consider the wider effects of rising inflation and that without any further funding, the Scottish Government may only be able to propose similar pay rises by reducing budgets elsewhere which would have a knock-on impact on the public sectorâ€™s ability to respond more widely to the cost of living crisis.
Mr Swinney's letter to the Chancellor can be read online.

Investment of up to Â£300,000 will help support money and welfare advice services in some of Scotlandâ€™s most remote locations.
From the autumn, GP practices in 20 rural and 10 island communities will be able to refer patients directly to an in-house welfare rights officer for advice on increasing income, social security eligibility, debt resolution, housing and employability issues.
They will build on the work already being undertaken at nearly 150 GP practices in the most deprived areas of the country as part of the Welfare Advice and Health Partnerships programme.
Speaking on a visit to the Forge Medical Practice in Glasgow, which has offered the service since 2021, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:
â€œThe cost of living crisis is on everyoneâ€™s mind right now and we know the impact that can have on peopleâ€™s mental and physical health, particularly those who are struggling the most to make ends meet.
â€œDedicated money and welfare advice in the same location where people are already receiving mental and physical health support is about providing people with more convenient access to the help they need, whilst also reaching those who do not engage with traditional advice services.
â€œThis funding will ensure people in rural and island communities have access to the same advice and support, given the particular challenges they also face from the rising cost of living, including fuel and food inflation.
â€œThe Scottish Government is committed to mitigating the impact of increased costs, and this action is in addition to the almost Â£3 billion already allocated this year by Ministers to help households cope with the pressures so many are facing.â€
Background
Cost of Living Support
Welfare Advice and Health Partnerships
The Scottish Government is funding the Welfare Advice Service Facilitator (WASF), hosted byÂ the Improvement Service, to support the development of money and welfare advice and health partnerships within healthcare settings.
Advice is provided by a money and welfare advice worker within the practice. They typically have one or more session within the practice each week.Â 
New participating surgeries will be identified from areas where cost of living is already disproportionately high and people are likely to be more heavily impacted by the current cost of living crisis.Â 
An evaluation of the original scheme, which covered nine GP surgeries in Glasgow, showed the average financial gain to individuals accessing WAHPs was over Â£19 for every Â£1 invested in the scheme, and over Â£25 for every Â£1 invested when debt negotiation and management was included over a period of 12 months.

Cost of living crisis:Â find out what help is available



Funding for 2022-23 includes:

Â£294.4 million for Scottish Child Payment and other family benefits, including Best Start Grants, Best Start Foods and Bridging Payments
 Â£64 million for universal provision of free school meals during term time for children in p4 and p5 and alternative holiday provision for eligible children
 Â£306 million for concessionary travel
 Â£437 million to help with household bills via Council Tax Reduction and Water Charge Reduction
Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison said:

â€œWithin our limited budget, we have allocated almost Â£3 billion in this financial year to help families and households face the increased cost of living. This includes support for energy bills, childcare, health and travel, as well as social security payments not available anywhere else in the UK.

â€œWe are increasing our Scottish Child Payment to Â£25 per child per week when we extend it to under 16s by the end of 2022. This will mean a 150% increase in less than a year and around 400,000 children eligible for this vital anti-poverty benefit.

â€œWestminster holds most of the powers needed to tackle the cost of living crisis as well as borrowing and resourcing powers we do not currently have. This includes energy, the minimum wage, National Insurance and 85% of social security spending.

â€œThe UK Governmentâ€™s decade of austerity and welfare reforms have placed people in a particularly precarious position. That is why we have continually urged them to use all the powers and fiscal headroom at their disposal to put together a comprehensive action plan to address the long term impacts of rising prices and provide immediate support to struggling households.

â€œIn the meantime we will continue to use our limited budget and constrained powers to work for people and help cushion the impact of UK Government policies.â€

Thousands of children from low-income families will benefit from free childcare, activities and healthy food as part of a Â£10 million summer programme.
Available to children and young people aged five to 14 years old who need it most, the funding has been allocated to local authorities to supplement existing holiday programmes or to develop new ones.
Education Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said:
â€œSchool holidays can be expensive for families, especially when household bills are soaring. This funding means children and young people who really need it will be able to access coordinated childcare, activities and nutritious food over the summer.
â€œThey will have opportunities to play, socialise and access a range of activities that broaden their experiences and supplement their learning.
â€œSupport will be targeted at the six priority family types at greatest risk of poverty, including lone parent families and families with a disabled adult or child. We have a national mission to tackle child poverty and, along with Â£21.75 million in funding for alternative holiday food provision for families eligible for free school meals, this offer will provide much-needed support over the summer.â€
COSLA Children and Young People's Spokesperson Councillor Tony Buchanan said:
â€œThe rising cost of living is exacerbating the already stark and unacceptable reality of poverty in the lives of children, young people, families and communities. We are pleased that this additional funding will enable local authorities to build on their regular summer programmes to enhance opportunities and support for priority groups of children and young people.
Â 
â€œCouncils and their local delivery partners will provide varied programmes, incorporating activities, childcare, and food provision, in line with local needs and guided by what children, young people, and families themselves say will make a difference.â€Â 
Background
To support the summer holiday funding, the Scottish Government is encouraging local authorities to work in close partnership with the third sector, the out-of-school care sector and community and youth groups, harnessing their expertise to design and run services and activities that reflect the needs of local families.

Cost of living crisis:Â find out what help is available



A growing number of families are accessing funded Early Learning and Childcare (ELC) across Scotland.

Â The latest figures show that 121,101 children were in funded ELC places at the end of April 2022 â€“Â an increase of 9,527 since January 2022.

The entitlement to funded ELC increased to 1,140 hours in August last year, saving families up to Â£4,900 annually for each eligible child.

The ELC workforce also continues to increase, up 357 since January 2022, with 18,421 (FTE) staff now working in the sector. This marks a rise of 8,845 since 2016/17.

Childrenâ€™s Minister Clare Haughey said:

â€œIt is clear funded ELC is making a real difference to families â€“ particularly at a time when so many are struggling with the rising cost of living.

â€œCrucially, high quality ELC also helps to provide children with skills and confidence to carry into school education, and is a cornerstone for closing the poverty-related attainment gap.

â€œItâ€™s also encouraging to see the workforce continue to grow and Iâ€™d like to thank everyone working in the sector for their continued hard work and dedication.â€

Councillor Tony Buchanan, COSLA Children and Young People's spokesperson said:

â€œIâ€™m pleased that todayâ€™s figures confirm that over 121,000 children are accessing additional funded early learning and childcare hours from Scotlandâ€™s Councils and their partners. The increased availability of funded early learning and childcare is allowing children more time to play and learn, and more opportunities for parents and carers to work, study or volunteer, as well as significant financial savings for families.Â 

â€œI particularly welcome that there has been a 15% increase in the number of eligible two-year-olds accessing increased hours between April 2021 and April 2022, as we know this will provide support for children and families who will benefit most.â€

Background

The figures are set out in the Improvement Service's May 2022 Early Learning and Childcare Expansion Delivery Progress Report.

Legislation came into effect on 1 August 2021 to make the expanded offer of 1,140 hours available across Scotland.

Record investment of almost Â£8.5 billion was committed to support low income households between 2018-22, with almost Â£3.3 billion benefitting children.
The fourth annual progress report on child poverty, published today, shows that all of the actions committed as part of the first Tackling Child Poverty Delivery Plan, Every Child, Every Chance, have been delivered.
The plan focused on three drivers of child poverty reduction â€“ work and earnings, social security and household costs â€“ and on the six priority family types at greatest risk of poverty, including lone parent families and families with a disabled adult or child.
Key achievements over the life of the plan (2018-22) include:
introduction of the Scottish Child Payment, with more than 1.2 million payments between February 2021 and March 2022 â€“ a Â£58.6 million investment
increase in the number of real Living Wage accredited employers, with the proportion of people earning the real Living Wage or more rising from 80.6%Â in 2018 to 85.6% in 2021
increase in the funded hours for Early Learning and Childcare from 600 hours in 2018 to 1,140 hours in August 2021, saving families up to Â£4,900 per eligible child in 2021
delivery of 35,095 affordable homes, 25,562 of which were for social rent â€“ supporting an estimated 11,585 households with children into affordable housing between 2018-22
extension of concessionary travel to all under 22s, with approximately 930,000 young people eligible for support â€“ saving families up to Â£3,000 by the time their child turns 18
expansion of universal free school meals to children in primaries 4 and 5, saving families around Â£400 per child and increasing School Clothing Grant to at least Â£120 for eligible primary school children and Â£150 for those in secondary school in 2021
Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison said:
â€œOver the last four years, we have strengthened the foundations of support for children and families and used our powers to support those most in need, particularly with the introduction of our new social security system.
â€œWe are now supporting low income households, carers and helping disabled people lead independent lives through 12 benefits, seven of which are entirely new and not available anywhere else in the UK.
â€œWe have made progress despite significant challenges. The pandemic and the continued impact of UK Government welfare reforms has disproportionately impacted the most disadvantaged and been severe. And, of course, households are all now facing the current cost of living crisis.
â€œThat is why we remain determined to continue with our national mission to tackle child poverty.Â  Our second Tackling Child Poverty Delivery Plan for 2022-26, Best Start, Bright Futures, is ambitious and has a range of actions to support families both immediately and in the long term to deliver change.
â€œWe will also continue to call on the UK Government to reverse their welfare reforms, including the two-child limit. Analysis shows that reversing them would put an estimated Â£780 million in the pockets of Scottish households in 2023-24 and help to lift 70,000 people out of poverty, including 30,000 children.â€

Scotlandâ€™s Baby Box has been refreshed in time for its fifth anniversary.
The new look box has updated clothing designs and now includes a baby toothbrush to support early oral health.
Every newborn in Scotland is entitled to a Baby Box, with around 222,450 delivered to families since the scheme began in August 2017.
Speaking during a visit to APS (Group) Scotland in Edinburgh, who pack and distribute the box, Childrenâ€™s Minister Clare Haughey said:
â€œAs every parent knows, the costs associated with having a baby are significant. Household budgets are under increasing pressure from the rising cost of living, so it is reassuring to know that all families in Scotland, regardless of their circumstances, have access to essential items needed for the first six months of their newbornâ€™s life.
â€œUptake for the Baby Box has grown to about 98% since it was introduced in 2017. As we head towards the fifth anniversary, I am proud that the Baby Box continues to support newborns and their families.â€
Chief Dental Officer Tom Ferris said:
â€œI am really pleased to see a toothbrush included in the Baby Box for the first time.Â  Good oral habits are essential to achieving excellent mouth health, and this will allow us to support families in achieving this from the very beginning of life.â€
Beverley Walsh, Head of Services at APS Group (Scotland), said:
â€œThe Baby Box initiative has created sustainable employment opportunities for local people, where possible supporting targeted groups. We work with training organisations, local schools and colleges, with the Baby Box supporting up to four modern apprenticeship positions and work experience placements each year.â€
Background

                        Independent report into funding for tax and welfare devolution.
                    

Â 
An assessment will be carried out into how funding for the Scottish Government is calculated.
During a meeting of the Joint Exchequer Committee (JEC) the UK and Scottish Governments announced an independent report has been commissioned to evaluate the block grant adjustment funding arrangements for tax and welfare devolution against the principles agreed by the Smith Commission.
The report is expected to be delivered within four months, and its findings will inform a broader review of the Scottish Governmentâ€™s Fiscal Framework.
Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Economy Kate Forbes said:
â€œOur experiences of dealing with the pandemic and supporting those struggling with the cost of living crisis clearly demonstrate how difficult it is to take vital action without sufficient fiscal powers.
â€œThe forthcoming review of the Fiscal Framework is an opportunity to consider the future of Scotlandâ€™s funding arrangements in the interests of fairness, accountability and sound governance. This independent report is an important step in that process and I look forward to hearing from a wide range of stakeholders throughout the process.â€
Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke said:
""Launching this independent report is an important step in our review of the Fiscal Framework, which ensures fair and sustainable funding for Scotland's future, and I look forward to reading the findings later this year.
""We are stronger together, and I am committed to continuing to work with the Scottish Government on a way forward, not just for the review of the Fiscal Framework, but across all of the big issues of the day.""
Background
The Finance Secretary and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury attended an online meeting of the Joint Exchequer Committee (JEC) today. The JEC is the intergovernmental ministerial forum to discuss financial and fiscal matters relating to the Scotland Act 2016 and accompanying Fiscal Framework.
The original Fiscal Framework agreement states that a review of the framework should occur after a parliament's worth of experience, and that the review should be preceded by an Independent Report presented to both governments.Â The review will begin shortly after the report has been completed.
The independent report will be co-authored by Professor David Bell (University of Stirling), David Eiser (Fraser of Allander Institute at the University of Strathclyde) and David Phillips (Institute for Fiscal Studies), who are leading experts and have published extensively on the Fiscal Framework.
A call for evidence from stakeholders is planned to open at the end of July and close by mid- September 2022. Further details on how to contribute will be announced in due course.
Changes to the Scottish block grant are largely calculated by the Barnett formula, but adjustments need to be made to reflect that some of the budget is now funded by Scottish tax revenues previously retained by the UK Government, and because the Scottish Government now has responsibility for elements of welfare.

                        Maintaining a balanced budget to fund key priorities.
                    

The 2021-22 Provisional Outturn has been published detailing how the Scottish Government spent Â£47 billion on funding key public services to mitigate the impacts of the Covid pandemic and help tackle rising cost of living pressures.
The remaining Â£650 million of available funding has been carried over through the Scotland Reserve and allocated to support key priorities for 2022-23, which include tackling child poverty and striving towards our climate change targets.Â 
The Finance Secretary has previously made clear to Parliament that unexpected and late consequential funding from the UK Government was being factored into spending plans for 2022-23 and that any plan to carry forward funding requires the Government to use the Scotland Reserve, which will therefore be presented as an underspend.
Throughout 2021-22 the Scottish Government has:
spent over Â£5.7 billion in relation to Covid, including over Â£2.6 billion to support health and wider public health initiatives, and around Â£1.5 billion in business support and self-isolation grants
provided over Â£3.5 billion on Social Security benefits, including Â£57 million towards the Scottish Child Payment
committed an additional Â£4 million of humanitarian aid, as the first part of a contribution to support the Ukraine crisis
invested a record Â£1.9 billion to tackle climate changeÂ 
Public Finance Minister Tom Arthur said:
â€œThe Scottish Government has had to respond quickly and decisively to significant challenges, in particular the ongoing effects of the pandemic, the cost of living crisis and the tragic illegal war in Ukraine. However, despite these difficult circumstances, our prudent financial management has meant every penny received by the Scottish Government has been channelled to where it was needed the most.Â 
â€œWe face the same interrelated challenges as other governments across the world but we do so â€“ currently - without the tools and levers other governments have at their disposal. The current fiscal framework is inadequate and leaves an imbalance between the risks to which the Scottish Budget is exposed to and the levers that we have to manage those risks.Â 
â€œWe have delivered on our priorities, maintained the balance of not breaching our fixed budgetary limits and ensured we have sufficient balances to fund our 2022-23 spending commitments.â€
BACKGROUND
Read the statement made to Parliament by Public Finance Minister
Read the Scottish Budget 2022-23
The overall underspend for 2021-22 is Â£650 million and is split between:
a Â£421 million resource underspend. Resource budgets fund the day to day costs of delivering public services
a Â£183 million capital underspend. Capital budgets support the delivery of public infrastructure
a Â£46 million financial transactions underspend which can only be used for loans or equity investments to bodies outside the public sector
The majority of this carry forward was anticipated and is already included in 2022-23 funding plans, specifically: Â£324 million anticipated within the initial 2022-23 Budget, and Â£120 million to support Local Government 2022-23 costs at stage 1 of the Budget Bill process. The remaining balance of Â£206 million represents just 0.4% of the Scottish Government budget.Â 
The Finance Secretary informed the Finance and Public Administration Committee on 1st February that if any carry forward was required, the Scottish Government would have to use the Scotland reserve. Speaking then, Kate Forbes said: â€œAs members may be aware, any plan to carry forward funding requires the Government to use the Scotland reserve, which will therefore be presented as an underspend on this yearâ€™s funding when the final outturn is published later this calendar year. I hope that we can all recall our conversation at todayâ€™s committee when it comes to scrutinising that position later this year.â€            ",6/23/2022,Managing Scotlandâ€™s finances

                        Extra money for unemployed young people who are starting work
                    

Eligible 16-24 year olds who are already receiving certain other benefits or tax credits are being encouraged to apply for Job Start Payment - a one-off payment worth Â£267.65, or Â£428.25 if the applicant has children.
Job Start Payment helps young people with the costs of starting a job after a period of being unemployed. The payment can help with the costs of travel, work clothes or childcare.
Speaking at Start Scotland, which delivers an employability programme supporting young people in Edinburgh, Minister for Social Security Ben Macpherson said:
â€œOur Job Start Payment provides financial support for eligible young people who are starting a new job. We have provided this payment since summer 2020 and want to see even more people making use of it, particularly given the current cost of living pressures.
â€œThe payment is designed to support young people with the costs of starting a job by relieving financial pressures, as they wait for their first pay cheque.
â€œWe are also helping young people to access education and employment by providing free bus travel to all under 22 year olds. This will help young people travel sustainably, while cutting commuting costs for people starting a new job â€“ meaning that young people can use their Job Start Payment to pay for other costs.
â€œI would encourage anyone who thinks they may be eligible to find out more from Social Security Scotland and apply for this benefit, which is only available in Scotland.â€
Job Start Payment is available to eligible young people who have been offered a job after being out of work for at least six months to the day they were offered the job and are in receipt of a qualifying benefit. Care leavers can apply for a further year, up to the day before their 26th birthday, and only need to be out of work and in receipt of a qualifying benefit on the day of their job offer.
Young people can find pre-application advice for Job Start Payment, which includes eligibility and award amounts, and apply at the mygov.scot website.            ",6/22/2022,Young people urged to apply for Job Start Payment

                        Rural Affairs Secretary confirms change to payment strategy.
                    

Annual farm payment dates are to be brought forward to September, in an effort to support Scotlandâ€™s farmers with cash flow and the cost of living crisis.
Rural Affairs Secretary Mairi Gougeon has confirmed that, subject to the approval of the Scottish Parliament, farmers and crofters will receive their advance payment for the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Greening around a month earlier than originally planned.
The decision follows a request from farming groups in Scotland to relieve immediate inflationary pressures and protect jobs in Scotlandâ€™s world-leading food and drink sector.
Following a review of the legislative, IT and budget requirements to bring the date forward, payments will now start to issue from 19 September 2022 instead of 16 October 2022.
Rural Affairs Secretary Mairi Gougeon said:
â€œGiven the sharp rise in energy, fuel and fertiliser costs in recent months, I am acutely aware that businesses across Scotland are facing a hugely challenging increase in their bills.
â€œThis is compounding the challenging operating environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the hard Brexit imposed on Scotland by the UK Government, which has inflicted significant and lasting damage on our world class food and drink industries, rural and coastal communities.
â€œThat is why I have listened to the representations from the farming and crofting community and will bring forward the advance payment start date to as early in the year as is practicably possible. The intention is to support businesses, as far as possible, with immediate cash flow challenges.
â€œWhile the start date of payments may change, the target remains the same - to pay over 70% anticipated expenditure by end December 2022 and 95.24% anticipated expenditure by end February 2023.â€
Annually, the Scottish Government pays out around Â£420 million through the Basic Payment Scheme and Greening payments.
In 2022 the Scottish Governmentâ€™s farm payment strategy will see a transition away from providing manual loan payments to automated scheme advance payments.

Finance Ministers across the UK met in Cardiff today, with how to support people and businesses with soaring bills dominating discussion.
The price of food, fuel, energy, clothes, travel costs and rent continue to go up as inflation rises. And OFGEM has warned energy bills are set to rise again by around Â£800 per year in October. This is against the backdrop of increasing concerns about the impact of the crisis on individualsâ€™ health and wellbeing.
The UKâ€™s Finance Ministers discussed what more can be done to help people cope with this crisis at a joint Committee which considers fiscal and economic matters affecting the UK. Todayâ€™s meeting was the first time the Committee met in Cardiff.
Ministers also considered concerns about EU replacement funding, as well as Covid recovery and the move towards net zero. The need to invest in renewables to ensure energy security was discussed, along with how to make sure people are able to meet the costs of their energy needs now and in the future.
Following the meeting, the Northern Irish, Scottish and Welsh Ministers visited South Point Primary School in Rhoose â€“ Walesâ€™ first net zero school.
Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Economy Kate Forbes said:
â€œAs we continue our economic recovery from the pandemic and the ongoing cost of living crisis, we must firmly focus government and public sector resources on delivering clear priorities, including tackling child poverty, growing the economy and meeting our climate change targets.
â€œAccording to the Scottish Fiscal Commission (SFC), the overall Scottish Budget fell by 5.2% in real terms between 2021-22 and 2022-23 with a further 1% real-terms reduction forecast sustained until 2025-26.
â€œWhile we are doing all we can with the finite financial resources and limited powers currently available to us to tackle the rising cost of living, the UK Government needs to use the powers at its disposal to help those most in need, including low income households and families with children as well as businesses.â€
Wales's Minister for Finance and Local Government Rebecca Evans said:
â€œThe UK Government needs to use the levers at its disposal to take further urgent steps to target gaps in support, particularly to help lower income households and families with children, and to boost businesses who are also feeling the impacts of rising costs.
Removing all social and environmental policy costs from household energy bills, for example, and introducing a lower price cap for lower income households, would help them to meet the costs of their energy needs now and in the future.
Our budget is now worth at least Â£600m less than when we made our spending plans last year. We call on the Chancellor to increase it in line with inflation so that we can support NHS recovery following the pandemic, invest in jobs and growth, and boost our cost of living response.â€
Commenting after the meeting, Northern Ireland's Finance Minister Conor MurphyÂ said:Â 
""The collective message to Treasury today was clear - more must be done to help households and businesses facing an unprecedented cost of living crisis. While Treasury has announced assistance for citizens they must now look at supportingÂ businesses which are also facing increased fuel and energy costs against a backdrop of trying to recover from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Along with the Welsh and Scottish Finance Ministers I impressed upon the Chief Secretary to the Treasury the need for further measures to be taken. I once again called on Treasury to reduce VAT on energy bills.
â€œI also reiterated to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury the need to ensure the citizens of the North are not disadvantagedÂ when it comes to the Â£400 Energy Bill Support Scheme payment because of the absence of an Executive. We haveÂ committed to continue the engagement between my Department and Treasury to ensure a solution is found to deliver support locally.â€

                        FM: â€˜Itâ€™s time to talk about independenceâ€™
                    

Setting out the fresh case for Scotland to become an independent country began today as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon declared â€˜Itâ€™s timeâ€™ and published new analysis showing the prize of independence is a wealthier, fairer Scotland.

The Scottish Government analysis â€“ Independence in the Modern World. Wealthier, Happier, Fairer: Why Not Scotland? â€“ details how neighbouring countries such as Sweden, Ireland, Denmark and Finland use their powers of independence to achieve economic success, business dynamism and fairer societies.

The evidence shows that:

the comparator countries are all wealthier â€“ some a lot wealthier â€“ than the UK
 income inequality is lower in all the comparator countries
 poverty rates are lower in all the comparator countries
 there are fewer children living in poverty in all the comparator countries
 the comparator countries all have higher productivity â€“ often significantly higher â€“ than the UK
 business investment tends to be higher in all the comparator countriesÂ  Â  Â 
It is the first in a series of papers called Building a New Scotland that will together form a prospectus for an independent Scotland to enable people to make an informed choice about Scotlandâ€™s future before any referendum takes place.

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:

â€œToday, Scotland â€“ like countries across the world â€“ faces significant challenges. But we also have huge advantages and immense potential. The refreshed case for independence is about how we equip ourselves to navigate the challenges and fulfil that potential, now and in future.

â€œIn their day to day lives, people across Scotland are suffering the impacts of the soaring cost of living, low growth and increasing inequality, constrained public finances and the many implications of a Brexit we did not vote for. These problems have all been made worse or, most obviously in the case of Brexit, directly caused by the fact we are not independent.

â€œSo at this critical juncture we face a fundamental question. Do we stay tied to a UK economic model that consigns us to relatively poor economic and social outcomes which are likely to get worse, not better, outside the EU? Or do we lift our eyes, with hope and optimism, and take inspiration from comparable countries across Europe?

â€œComparable neighbouring countries with different characteristics. Countries that, in many cases, lack the abundance of resources that Scotland is blessed with. But all of them independent and, as we show today, wealthier and fairer than the UK.

â€œTodayâ€™s paper â€“ and those that will follow in the weeks and months ahead â€“ is about substance. That is what really matters. The strength of the substantive case will determine the decision people reach when the choice is offered â€“ as it will be â€“ and it is time now to set out and debate that case.

â€œAfter everything that has happened it is time to set out a different and better vision. It is time to talk about making Scotland wealthier and fairer. It is time to talk about independence â€“ and then to make the choice.â€

Scottish Government Minister and Scottish Green Party Co-Leader Patrick Harvie said:

â€œThis paper sets out a detailed, evidence-based assessment of how the UK performs in comparison to a group of European countries. It shows how we are being held back environmentally, socially and economically by a UK Government that does not have the interests of the people of Scotland in mind. And it shows that with the powers of independence we could make different decisions than those made by the UK government, and build a more prosperous, equal and greener Scotland.

â€œAs we seek to deliver the transition to a net-zero economy and address a cost of living crisis that is being turbo-charged by Brexit, there could not be a more important time to give the people of Scotland a choice over our future. The Building a New Scotland papers will help ensure that choice is an informed one, and I hope that everyone will join us in a positive and constructive national debate about Scotlandâ€™s future.â€

                        Calls for further engagement on Northern Ireland Protocol.
                    

Scottish Ministers are calling on the UK Government to withdraw legislation aiming to abandon parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol negotiated with the European Union.
Following the publication of the legislation, External Affairs Secretary Angus Robertson has reiterated the danger that disregarding parts of the UK-EU Withdrawal Agreement could lead to a trade war when the UK is already close to recession and in the middle of a cost of living crisis.
Mr Robertson said:
â€œIt is extremely reckless and frustrating that the UK Government has decided to bring forward this legislation. The UK Government has deliberately set itself on an entirely avoidable collision course with the EU. Brexit is forecast to cause more harm to the economy than COVID, and this action by the UK Government could trigger significant additional damage to our economy when we are already facing the worst cost of living crisis seen for decades.
â€œScotland has direct interests at stake in the Protocol, particularly in trade and border control, and yet the UK Government has shown no willingness to engage us on these issues. It is also directly impacting other Scottish interests, such as participation in the flagship Horizon Europe research programme. Â 
â€œWe have repeatedly called for the UK Government to step back from this confrontational approach and focus instead on dialogue with our European partners, who stand willing to work in partnership to find a negotiated solution. Those calls have also been ignored.
â€œWe urge the UK Government to return to the negotiating table and withdraw this Bill. It is inconceivable to think that the Scottish Government would recommend legislative consent for a bill that would negatively impact Scotlandâ€™s economy, that could be deemed to break international law and could risk sparking a trade war with our fellow Europeans, which is in no oneâ€™s interests.â€
Background
Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts indicate that the impact of Brexit on UK productivity will be worse in the long run than COVID-19. OBR analysis indicates Brexit will reduce the UKâ€™s potential productivity by 4% in the long run, whereas the pandemic is expected to reduce it by 2%.

                        Low Income Winter Heating Assistance will support 400,000 households.
                    

A guaranteed annual winter heating benefit of Â£50 will be paid for the first time in February 2023 to around 400,000 low income households.
Low Income Winter Heating Assistance will be the Scottish Governmentâ€™s 13th benefit and replaces the UK Governmentâ€™s Cold Weather Payments. The UK Government benefit is unreliable for households on low incomes as it only triggers a Â£25 payment when a â€˜cold spellâ€™ requirement is met and temperatures fall below zero degrees Celsius for seven days in a row in a certain place.
Instead, the Scottish Government will invest an annual Â£20 million in Low Income Winter Heating Assistance, which will provide a reliable payment every winter to help with energy bills.
Plans for Low Income Winter Heating Assistance have been welcomed by people with experience of the benefits system. 90 per cent of members of the Social Security Experience Panel agreed with the plan to remove the â€˜cold spellâ€™ requirement, and provide a reliable payment instead.
Social Security Minister Ben Macpherson said:
â€œOur new Low Income Winter Heating Assistance benefit will provide a reliable payment every winter to around 400,000 eligible households, including pensionersÂ  and disabled people. This extra financial support from the Scottish Government will help at this time of rising energy bills and other cost of living pressures.
â€œUnlike the current Cold Weather Payments, Low Income Winter Heating Assistance will provide support to people irrespective of weather conditions or temperature levels where they live.Â It will be our thirteenth devolved benefit and will only be available in Scotland. It will also be an automatic payment to all those who are eligible, so there is no need to apply.
â€œOur Â£20 million annual investment will be a significant increase in support to around 400,000 households â€“ compared with only Â£325,000 and 11,000 payments made by the UK Government in Cold Weather Payments in Scotland in winter 21-22.
â€œMaking payments in February for the first year of Low Income Winter Heating Assistance will ensure a smooth transition from the UK scheme. We will explore the feasibility of bringing forward the payment date to earlier in winter in future years.
â€œThis winter we will also be extending and increasing our Scottish Child Payment in November, as well as making Child Winter Heating Assistance payments for the third time. Both of these benefits are not available elsewhere in the UK.â€
Background
The Social Security Experience Panel informs key decisions in the design of social security in Scotland and members were asked between February and March 2022 about Low Income Winter Heating Assistance.
The Consultation Analysis of Low Income Winter Heating Assistance and the Scottish Government's response have also been published.
The current UK Governmentâ€™s Cold Weather Payments triggers a Â£25 payment only when temperatures are recorded or forecast at below zero degrees Celsius for seven days in a row. Low Income Winter Heating Assistance will provide financial stability through an automatic Â£50 payment, no matter the weather.
Low Income Winter Heating Assistance is the 13th benefit to be introduced by the Scottish Government. A â€˜qualifying weekâ€™ has been set for November, with the money paid to all eligible households in February 2023.
An individual may be eligible to receive Low Income Winter Heating Assistance if they are in receipt of any ofÂ Pension Credit, Income Support, income-based Jobseekers Allowance, income-related Employment and Support Allowance, Universal Credit and Support for Mortgage Interest. As with the current Cold Weather Payments, additional qualifying criteria for some of these benefits may also need to be satisfied, for example in relation to disability premiums paid to the client or if a disabled child is in their household.

                        Latest statistics demonstrate the resilience of the economy.
                    

Newly published statistics show Scotlandâ€™s economy grew 1% in the first quarter of 2022, despite public health restrictions in place to tackle the Omicron variant.
First estimates for January â€“ March 2022 show economic growth has been driven by increased outputs in the Construction (2.5%) and Services (1.0%) sectors.
Separate monthly GDP statistics show 0.3% economic growth in March 2022.Â 
The statistics follow the publication of the EY Attractiveness Survey 2022, finding that Scotland outperformed the UK as whole when it comes to attracting Foreign Direct Investment projects, a key driver of economic growth.Â 
The Scottish Government has recently outlined plans to focus public finances in the coming years to support the ambition to build a stronger, fairer and greener economy as one of four key priorities in the Resource Spending Review.
The Resource Spending Review commits to investing almost Â£880 million to support the economy, in addition to plans for continuing the Inward Investment Plan to attract more high quality inward investment in the opportunity areas and increase export growth.
Commenting on the statistics, Economy Secretary Kate Forbes said:
â€œItâ€™s been an unprecedented time for Scotlandâ€™s economy â€“ from managing the many impacts of the pandemic, mitigating the ongoing effects of Brexit, the cost of living crisis and inflation at a record 40 year high.
â€œThese statistics show, that despite these vast and complex challenges, the public, private and third sectors that make up Scotlandâ€™s economy are resilient and have continued to grow by 1% in the first quarter of 2022.
â€œWe will continue to support families and businesses though this period, including investing almost Â£770 million this year through measures such as Scottish social security payments that are not available elsewhere in the UK, mitigating the bedroom tax and increasing the Scottish Child Payment to Â£25. The UK Government need to do more with the powers they have to support families and businesses through the cost of living crisis.
â€œWe have provided more than Â£4.7 billion in business support since the beginning of the pandemic, including around Â£1.6 billion in rates relief which includes a continuation of 50% retail, hospitality, and leisure rates relief for the first three months of 2022-23, capped at Â£27,500 per ratepayer.
â€œThe newly published Resource Spending Review will support delivery of the initial phase of the National Strategy for Economic Transformation, in line with our ambitions to create a fairer and more prosperous country.â€

                        Record social security investment in Resource Spending Review.
                    

More than Â£23 billion in social security payments are set to be delivered by the Scottish Government over the next four years, helping lift children out of poverty and mitigate the rising cost of living.
In line with Scottish Fiscal Commission forecasts, almost Â£1.8 billion is being committed to the Scottish Child Payment, which will increase to Â£25 per eligible child per week when the payment is extended to under-16s at the end of 2022.
The Resource Spending Review also allocates up to Â£300 million to tackle child poverty and deliver wider measures to reduce household costs, with separate funding to provide free school meals and boost parents' career prospects.
Finance Secretary Kate Forbes and Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison visited St Bernardâ€™s Primary School in Glasgow this morning to hear from parents who have received support through Social Security Scotlandâ€™s family benefits.
Ms Forbes said:
â€œWe are determined that nothing deflects us from our mission to tackle child poverty and deliver a fairer Scotland.
â€œOur Scottish Child Payment â€“ now reaching an estimated 103,000 children and with investment of Â£55 million in its first year â€“ is at the heart of this work. This is the most ambitious step of its kind being undertaken anywhere in the UK to put money in the pockets of parents and carers who need it most.
â€œWe are already doing everything in our power to protect families from the cost of living crisis and give them a brighter future. If the UK Government matched our ambition to mitigate those impacts, the support we have prioritised in the spending review would mean that by 2023-24 there would be around 60,000 fewer children living in poverty than in 2017.â€
Ms Robison urged everyone to check they are not missing out on valuable financial support, including the Scottish Governmentâ€™s five family benefits. One of these, the Best Start Grant School Age Payment â€“ a one-off payment of Â£267.65 per child for families in receipt of certain benefits or tax credits â€“ opens for applications today.
â€œWe know the costs of starting school can mount up, especially when rising prices are hitting families hard. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re offering a package of support including five family benefits â€“ once weâ€™ve increased the Scottish Child Payment at the end of this year, our support could be worth more than Â£10,000 by the time an eligible familyâ€™s first child turns six,â€ Ms Robison said.
â€œI would encourage all households who think they could be eligible for benefits to check online, seek appropriate welfare advice, or get in touch with Social Security Scotland to find out more about the financial support they are eligible for. Social security is a human right and too many people are missing out on UK Government benefits, which may be a passport to receiving further support from Scotlandâ€™s social security system.â€
Background
The Resource Spending Review is a strategic framework sharing high-level plans for how funding will be invested in the coming years to meet Scottish Government priorities.
The measures set out in the tackling child poverty delivery plan 2022-26, Best Start, Bright Futures, will provide direct financial support to low-income families, including helping more than 300,000 children through the Scottish Child Payment.
To learn more about the Scottish Child Payment and to apply, visit mygov.scot/scottish-child-payment or call 0800 182 2222.
The first Official Statistics for the Scottish Child Payment were published on 31 May, covering the period to 31 March.
They show 1.2 million individual payments of Scottish Child Payment were made to more than 95,000 clients. It is estimated that 103,000 children were actively in receipt of Scottish Child Payment as at 31 March 2022. In the 2021/22 financial year, Scottish Child Payment paid out more than Â£55 million to low income families.
Best Start Grant School Age Payment, administered by Social Security Scotland, is now available to eligible families with children born between 1 March 2017 and 28 February 2018. The payment is for parents and carers receiving tax credits or certain benefits when their child becomes old enough to start primary school. Parents who have deferred their childâ€™s entry to school from August 2022 to August 2023, or those who are home-schooling, should apply this year. There is no cap on the number of children in a household who can get this payment. Children who started school last year, or who could have started school last year but who deferred until this year, are unfortunately no longer eligible.
School Age Payment applications are open until 28 February 2023. Visit mygov.scot/beststart or call 0800 182 2222 to find out more or apply.            ",6/1/2022,Prioritising national mission to tackle child poverty

                        Plans to invest in Scotlandâ€™s future.
                    

An ambitious but realistic public spending framework has been published which outlines how more than Â£180 billion will be invested to deliver priorities for Scotland.
The Resource Spending Review, which is not a budget, outlines how the Scottish Government will focus public finances in the coming years to tackle child poverty, address the climate crisis, strengthen the public sector as Scotland recovers from Covid and grow a stronger, fairer and greener economy.
A targeted capital spending review has also been published to address a reduction in capital investment by the UK Government.Â As well as supporting the NHS and affordable housing, the capital spending review will invest around Â£18 billion up to 31 March 2026, with over half a billion of additional funding directed to net zero programmes compared to previous plans.
Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said:
""We are of course still recovering from the Coronavirus pandemic. There is still acute pressure on the NHS, on business and the wider economy. The illegal Russian invasion of Ukraine is a humanitarian crisis, which is affecting the global economy. Rising energy prices and constrained supply chains have affected countries worldwide. While inflation is alsoÂ  impacting other countries, it is not impacting them equally.
""The UK currently has the highest inflation of any G7 countryâ€“ almost twice the rate of France. Â Brexit has made this problem worse, with increases in food prices, hitting the poorest hardest. We are experiencing an unprecedented cost of living crisis. Inflation is at a 40-year high of 9 per cent with households facing considerable hardship.
""Todayâ€™s Resource Spending Review is not a Budget. However, it is essential to share high-level financial parameters with public bodies, local government and the third sector, so we can plan ahead together.
""Today I set out an ambitious but realistic public spending framework for the years ahead. It does not ignore the realities of our financial position, but neither does it roll back on our ambitions for change.""
Further changes to Scotlandâ€™s fiscal position and to tax and social security forecasts are expected to change the funding picture ahead of annual budgets. The spending review however does prioritise sending in key policy areas. These are:
Tackling child poverty and supporting households and businesses with the cost of living
Â£22.9 billion for social security assistance
increasing the Scottish Child Payment from Â£10 to Â£25 and expanding eligibility by the end of this year
providing universal free school meals to primary school children in P1-5 and expanding provision beyond that
uprating devolved benefits
Securing stronger public services
investing Â£73.1 billion in health and social care including developing a National Care Service
increasing investment in frontline health services by 20 per cent over this Parliament
spending more on primary and community care to ensure people get the right treatment in the right place
funding of Â£42.5 billion for local government for the delivery of services
investing Â£11.6 billion in the justice system
Achieving net zero and tackling the climate crisis 
up to Â£75 million per year to deliver the Heat in Building Strategy, enabling Â£1.8 billion investment towards decarbonisation
up to Â£95 million towards meeting woodland creation targets
Â£46 million to introduce the community bus fund and an increase in funding for concessionary travel schemes
investment of over Â£12 million in peatland restoration
Â£4 million of resource spending alongside Â£150 million capital and financial investment for the North East and Moray Just Transition Fund
Building a stronger, fairer and greener economy
capital investment of Â£581 million to support the economy, including our enterprise agencies and the Scottish National Investment Bank
continuing through the Inward Investment Plan to attract high quality inward investment in areas such as energy transition and the space sector
pushing forward with the export growth plan A Trading Nation to scale up Scotlandâ€™s international reach
embedding entrepreneurship in education, to give young people opportunities to start and grow businesses
The spending review provides a platform for engagement ahead of the next budget on how best to reform Scotlandâ€™s high performing public sector to become more efficient, to deliver ambitious outcomes. That means rapidly digitalising the public sector, maximising revenue through public sector innovation, reforming the public sector estate and the public body landscape, and improving public procurement.
The annual Medium Term Financial Strategy has also been published to provide the economic and fiscal context for the Resource Spending Review and Capital Spending Review, including the fiscal challenges that lie ahead.

Prioritising public spending is essential to grow a stronger economy as Scotland recovers from the pandemic and faces up to the cost of living crisis, Finance Secretary Kate Forbes has said.
Speaking ahead of the publication of the Resource Spending Review, Ms Forbes said more focused government and public sector funds would achieve ambitions to tackle child poverty, reach net zero and deliver sustainable services for the future.
The Spending Review, which is not a budget, will give broad parameters for spending for the next four years and set out a series of government reforms.
Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said:
â€œThese are challenging times, and we need to be canny with our spending, but Iâ€™m confident that if we work together we can get through this cost of living crisis and still achieve our ambitions.
â€œThat means tackling child poverty, driving our economic recovery from COVID and achieving net zero, while building a stronger public sector that is sustainable for the future.
â€œWe face a very difficult financial position over the next few years with funding increases below inflation levels and the challenge of recovering from the pandemic without the financial tools available to every other government in the world.Â  That means while the spending review is not a budget, it will include difficult decisions, to ensure we can really focus on supporting households and services at this time.
â€œThe Resource Spending Review will detail the funding available over the coming years to achieve these goals, and it will be published alongside the Medium-Term Financial Strategy (MTFS) which gives economic context to the challenges and opportunities which lie ahead.""
Background
The Cabinet Secretary for Finance and the Economy will outline the Resource Spending Review to Parliament when it is published on May 31.
The Scottish Government is doing everything within its powers and fixed budgets to ensure people, communities and businesses are supported as far as possible, including investing almost Â£770 million this year in cost of living support and doubling the Scottish Child Payment to Â£20 per week. Earlier this year it increased eight Scottish benefits by 6%, the rate of inflation at the time, and introduced a range of benefits not available elsewhere in the UK.
Expanding free school meals and providing Â£150 council tax payments to low income families are included in further actions to put money back into peopleâ€™s pockets at a time when they need it most.            ",5/29/2022,Setting spending priorities for a stronger Scotland

                        App meets milestone on Menstrual Hygiene Day.
                    

A mobile app that helps people find free period products now links to over 1,000 places across Scotland.
The app, launched in January, is part of the world leading work that saw Scotland become the first country in the world to make period products widely available for free ahead of the Period Products Act coming into force in August.
Marking World Menstrual Hygiene Day, Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison also highlighted Scottish Government support for a project in Rwanda to help people make and sell reusable period products in their communities.
Ms Robison said:
â€œThe PickUpMyPeriod locator now connects to over 1000 locations across Scotland, making it easier than ever for people to access free period products when they need them. This is more important than ever at a time when people are making difficult choices due to the rising cost of living.
â€œAs we celebrate these world-leading achievements this Menstrual Hygiene Day, it is important to remember that not everyone has access to period products. However, it is inspiring to see other countries around the world taking our approach to period dignity. This also includes Rwanda, where weâ€™ve provided WaterAid with Â£100,000 to
equip women with the skills, tools and materials they need to produce affordable reusable period pads, enabling them to create a steady income.
â€œWe recognise that period dignity goes beyond provision of free period products, which is why we have also provided funding for a period dignity website for employers, run a successful anti-stigma campaign, and improved the menstrual health resources available for teachers.â€
Elizabeth McKernan, Partnerships Manager WaterAid Scotland said:
â€œThis year, we are focusing on the importance of having the right information and the right products and resources needed for a safe, healthy period. We believe that no one should be left in the dark, or in the red, when it comes to periods. That means, making sure that people have decent education about their menstrual cycle and menstrual hygiene, clean water to wash with and decent toilets to manage their period, and sanitary products to keep clean.
â€œWe welcome this important work here in Scotland by the Scottish Government and their support for our work in Rwanda, which is helping women and girls to manage their period with dignity.â€

The Scottish Government has invested over Â£27 million since 2017 to fund access to free period products across a range of settings including schools, colleges and universities, wider public spaces and targeted access through community groups for those on low incomes.
Scotlandâ€™s reputation for delivering period dignity has been commended globally, with countries including Austria, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand adopting a similar approach to meet their own needs. Scottish Government officials have also worked with counterparts in the Northern Ireland Executive on their bill to make period products available across a range of public settings, providing advice and sharing learning about the implementation of Scotlandâ€™s legislation.
The Period Products Act 2021 places duties on local authorities and education providers to make period products obtainable free of charge for anyone who needs them. The Act will ensure that everyone in Scotland who needs them can have reasonably convenient access to period products, free of charge, as and when they are required. In advance of this, free products continue to be available through education and community settings.
The Scottish Government funded Hey Girls to develop the PickupMyPeriod app, which allows users to identify locations where period products can be accessed for free in Scotland. The app is available to all local authorities to input their locations and, so far, the majority are involved. The locations currently listed may change as local authorities develop their implementation of the Act. For locations not listed on the app, information on how to access free period products should be available from local authorities.

                        Finance Secretary responds to Chancellorâ€™s statement.
                    

Finance Secretary Kate Forbes has welcomed the short term action announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but warned more support is needed for households and businesses as the cost of living crisis worsens.
Following calls from the Scottish Government, the UK Government has taken steps to ensure that cash grants, rather than loans, are provided to those on lowest incomes. Ms Forbes has also cautiously welcomed the decision to introduce a Windfall Tax on energy companies benefiting from significant profits but commented that it means Scottish industry is disproportionately funding interventions across the UK. Â Â Â 
Responding to the Chancellorâ€™s statement, Ms Forbes has said UK Ministers should have acted earlier and gone further to provide more support that would make a real long term impact, including following the Scottish Governmentâ€™s lead by doubling the Scottish Child Payment to Â£20 per week â€“ which is due to increase to Â£25 from late 2022 helping lift an estimated 50,000 children out of poverty in 2023-24.
Ms Forbes said:
â€œMany households will be relieved to see the support belatedly announced today, but we still need a long term solution to the cost of living crisis and reassurance that the UK Government is going to tackle long term inequalities rather than provide one-off bursts of crisis support.
â€œRather than listen to our plea for a comprehensive funding package that fully addresses the unprecedented rise in the cost of living and uses the full Â£30 billion of fiscal headroom, this piecemeal approach makes it highly likely that more support will be needed later when energy prices rise significantly in the autumn.
â€œThere is also a severe lack of support for businesses â€“ many of them are still struggling to recover from the pandemic and now face crippling increases in energy costs and the damaging impacts of Brexit on supply chains and the labour market. Without urgent economic support there is a real risk that the UK economy is heading for a recession.
â€œInflation is at its highest levels in 40 years and the UK Governmentâ€™s failure to fully invest in increasing incomes, tackling inequality and boosting economic competitiveness will only risk pushing households into further debt and poverty
â€œThe UK Government has almost Â£30 billion of fiscal headroom, spending only half of this during a cost of living crisis does not go far enough, especially when a further Â£5 billion from the Windfall Tax will be raised.
â€œThe introduction of a windfall tax is a start, but as a stand-alone measure this means Scottish industry is carrying the weight of UK-wide interventions. Â 
â€œThe removal of the Â£20 Universal Credit uplift last year was a hammer blow to hard pressed families and the Chancellorâ€™s failure to restore it and increase it to Â£25 only places a disproportionate burden on the shoulders of those who need help most. The statement was also worryingly silent on public-sector pay with no related consequential funding, when the lowest paid need urgent assurance in the face of rising inflation.
â€œThe refusal to reverse the National Insurance increase implemented in April and temporarily suspend VAT on household energy bills will also cost families hundreds of pounds annually at a time when their budgets have never been more squeezed.
â€œThe Scottish Government has already taken action to support people, communities and businesses as much as possible, with almost Â£770 million per year invested in cost of living support. We have increased eight Scottish benefits by 6%, closer to the rate of inflation, and introduced a range of family benefits not available elsewhere in the UK.

Â 

Households and businesses are struggling to cope with the cost of living crisis and need urgent action from the UK Government, according to Finance Secretary Kate Forbes.

With inflation reaching a 40 year high of 9 per cent, and forecast to rise higher, Ms Forbes has written to the Chancellor of the Exchequer urging the UK Government to use the Â£30 billion fiscal headroom it has available to help those struggling in the face of rising bills.

She said the Scottish Government is already taking action now to ensure targeted support is in place, within its reserved powers.

The letter states:

""I am writing to outline the pressing need to act on the cost of living crisis. With inflation reaching a 40 year high of 9 per cent and forecast to rise higher; Brexit increasing food prices by over 6%; and the news that the energy price cap is set to rise to Â£2,800 a year in October, it is absolutely imperative that further action is taken to relieve the acute pressures being felt by households and businesses. The Scottish Government has already taken action and will continue to do everything we can to ensure people, communities and businesses are supported as far as possible. But, given the restrictions of devolution, only the UK Government has the economic, regulatory levers and fiscal headroom required to address this urgent crisis.

""As you know, the Scottish Government has been making the case for action for some time. Even after the measures you have already announced, the Resolution Foundation estimates that the typical working age household will be around Â£1,000 worse off this year. This crisis is being felt even more severely by the lowest income households, with estimates that the inflation rate faced by the poorest 10% of households will be around a third higher than that faced by the richest 10%, due to the spiralling costs of food and energy forming a larger part of their Budget. All of this is before the further Â£800 increase in household energy bills expected in October.

""Moreover, the UK Governmentâ€™s disastrous Brexit policy has damaged the economy and worsened the cost of living crisis. A recent report from the London School of Economics provides evidence that it has led to a substantial increase in food prices, which will hit the poorest families hardest. This has contributed to the UK having one of the highest inflation rates in the G7.

""Implementing a timely, targeted and cohesive economic support package that fully utilises your Â£30 billion of fiscal headroom would support households and businesses that are struggling now. Continuing to delay is prolonging the impact of the cost of living crisis on incomes, economic competitiveness and inequality and pushing households into debt and poverty, and risks pushing the UK into a recession.

""I am proposing four principles that should guide a response from the UK Government:

""Firstly, ensure that the fiscal support package is targeted at the households and businesses that most need support. The package should aim to offset the disproportionate burden of the cost of living crisis on the least well-off, and I would urge you to consider as a starting point of any package:

An emergency cost of living cash payment to all UK households with below median income, tapered to provide more support to those at the lower end of the income distribution. I would suggest this be up to Â£1,000 to those on the lowest incomes, to be delivered directly as cash support at periods across the financial year. Providing money directly, without a link to specific bills, would provide households with the means to manage the cost of living crisis however it is affecting them the most, whether it is on food, transport or energy bills, and offset the impact of the cost of living crisis for those on the lowest incomes. The Resolution Foundation has also called for a policy intervention of a similar design.
 Permanently uprate all social security benefits as if they had been increased by 10% in April to match the current level of inflation, as proposed by the Centre for Social Justice. In April, we increased our eight Scottish social security benefits by 6%, reflecting the higher inflation expected at that time.
 A further Â£25 uplift to Universal Credit, and for this to be extended to legacy benefits.
 Increase the National Living Wage rate of Â£9.50 to the Real Living Wage rate of Â£9.90 for all over 18.
 A temporary suspension of VAT on household energy bills, which we estimate would save the average household around Â£100 a year at current prices.
 Extend the Â£350 energy rebate scheme to small and medium enterprises, and remove the requirement to repay to the Â£200 energy bill reduction component.
 Remove standing charges for anyone with a pre-payment meter. The energy price increases will be felt more severely for consumers using prepayment meters who are often subject to higher prices for energy than through other means such as direct debit, and as standing charges must still be paid even if there is no credit on the meter, and top ups can be swallowed up before energy can be bought. Removing standing charges would reduce the risk of self-disconnection if they cannot afford their energy costs.
""Collectively, we estimate this package can be comfortably implemented within the Â£30 billion fiscal headroom available to you, even before allowing for any additional revenue from a windfall tax.

""Secondly, ensure the increased burden of rising energy prices is shared fairly, by imposing a windfall tax applied to all companies benefiting from significantly higher profits over the pandemic and energy crisis. Â This is justified given the extraordinary rise in energy prices and the windfall in profits this has led to. However, oil and gas companies, who are disproportionately based in Scotland, are not the only businesses that have profited during the pandemic and current crisis. Any one-off windfall tax should be applied to all companies unfairly benefiting from significantly higher profits, to ensure that Scottish industry does not carry a disproportionate burden of funding a UK wide response.

""Thirdly, use the Â£30 billion of fiscal headroom you have against your current fiscal rules, along with any additional proceeds from a windfall tax, to deliver a timely and targeted fiscal support package. The OBRâ€™s forecasts published in March estimated that you are on course to meet your targets on public sector net debt and balancing the current budget in 2024-25 by around Â£28 billion and Â£32 billion respectively. Your headroom to respond would be increased further by the proceeds of any windfall tax. This provides ample space to support a significant fiscal response to the cost of living crisis.

""In the midst of such a crisis it would be unconscionable to hold this funding in reserve to fund tax cuts in future years. You should also give urgent consideration to relaxing your fiscal rules for the duration of this crisis to allow you to go further in your response.

""Finally, provide firm assurances about pay uplifts for our public sector workers, particularly the lowest paid, who, without support from your Government to bolster their pay packets in the face of inflation, face being pushed further into poverty. A firm commitment, if reflected in devolved Budgets, would give the Scottish Government the funding to provide better pay uplifts through upcoming pay settlements, helping the lowest paid public sector workers.Â 

""I propose these as prudent, targeted, initial measures to support households and businesses through the cost of living crisis, which would still remain consistent with your fiscal rules.

""I would also reiterate the proposals that I outlined to you before the Spring Statement, many of which are just as essential to support households and businesses now as they were in March. In particular, I urge you to consider:

Reversing the National Insurance increase implemented in April.
 Rebalancing the policy costs element of energy bills to reduce the premium paid by households reliant on electric heating, and to help to unlock the deployment of low and zero emissions heating.
 Committing to provide a Cold Weather Payment in winter 2022-23 when we know energy bills will have risen again.
""The package I propose above, along with these measures, would begin to address some of the impacts of inflation and the cost of living crisis on households and businesses.Â  I would also recommend you consider ways you can to take additional steps to reduce the increased prices in construction to prevent it inhibiting the development of public infrastructure â€“ for example, by lowering or removing VAT in this sector â€“ especially in housing construction.

""Energy bill increases could also be mitigated by changing the policy on the energy price cap, which I would urge you consider before the next scheduled increase. Furthermore, consumers who are not able to utilise gas or electricity for heating (for example those using heating oil and LPG, particularly prevalent in Scotland) face greater price increases without the protection of a regulated market.Â  Action should be taken to support them now.

""I have focused my requests on those areas reserved to the UK Government, which still holds many of the levers best able to offer focused support.Â  As you know, what the Scottish Government can do is severely limited by the Budget we receive from Westminster. The limitations on our ability to borrow means our spending power is also being eroded by inflation. As a result of escalating inflationary pressure, the Scottish Budget for 2022-23 was already reduced in real terms by 5.2 per cent relative to the previous year.

""This is not sustainable, and represents a creeping return to austerity. I would also urge you provide additional support to the Scottish Budget to allow us to provide support to households through the levers we have access to â€“ for example, through our policy on public sector pay. We intend to use whatever additional resources we receive from any cost of living spending to do all we can to meet the challenges Scottish households face on rising food prices, energy costs, and levels of pay.

""Although both the UK and Scottish Governments are faced with the same crisis in the cost of living, we do not have the same fiscal or regulatory powers to respond to these challenges. We are doing as much as we can within our resources, but, without the powers to control these policy levers ourselves, the UK Government must do more.

""Finally, I would welcome the opportunity to discuss further and set out in more detail the evidence and need for these interventions. Â I trust that you will welcome this.""

                        Meeting to discuss shared areas of interest has taken place at Bute House.
                    

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon welcomed Michelle Oâ€™Neill MLA to Bute House today (Friday 20 May).
The meeting provided an opportunity to discuss shared areas of interest including the current cost of living crisis, the importance of the Northern Ireland Protocol negotiated with the EU and the prospects for the formation of a new Northern Ireland Executive.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:
â€œTodayâ€™s meeting was an excellent opportunity to discuss some of the shared challenges Scotland and Northern Ireland face and I thank Michelle for reaching out and enabling us to discuss these extremely important issues in person.â€
â€œIt was a particularly timely conversation which provided an update on the ongoing developments around establishing the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive following elections earlier this month.
â€œWe also discussed the Northern Ireland protocol â€“ most notably the extremely concerning announcement by the UK Government that they intend to legislate to enable unilateral action to dis-apply parts of the protocol â€“ and the incredibly damaging effects this would have in communities right across the UK.Â In a cost of living crisis and teetering on the edge of recession, pitching us into a trade dispute with the EU could be what tips us over.
â€œIntergovernmental relations are essential when it comes to tackling shared challenges and it is clear that much more needs to be done by the UK Government to ensure a rapid and effective response to the devastating cost of living crisis facing households across these islands.Â No one should ever have to make a choice between heating and eating.
â€œTodayâ€™s meeting was a further example of the close relationship between Scotland and Northern Ireland.Â In that spirit, I have written today to the leaders of the DUP and Alliance parties with an offer to meet to discuss these important matters.â€

                        More than Â£3.9 billion to benefit 1 million people in 2022-23
                    

A report published today by Audit Scotland has highlighted the Scottish Governmentâ€™s â€œsignificant achievementâ€ in the scale and pace of delivering the devolved programme of social security benefits in Scotland, including seven new payments unavailable anywhere else in the UK. The report notes that this work continued despite ongoing challenges due to the pandemic. The report further acknowledges that the Scottish Government has continued to successfully deliver existing social security benefits and introduce complex new ones â€“ including Scottish Child Payment, Child Disability Payment and Adult Disability Payment â€“ in challenging circumstances.
The report also recognises the importance of social security in our collective national mission to tackle child poverty, mitigating the cost of living crisis and addressing inequalities.
In line with Scottish Fiscal Commission forecasts, the Scottish Government has committed over Â£3.9bn for benefit expenditure in 2022-23, providing support to more than one million people. This is over Â£360m above the level of funding to be received from the UK Government through Block Grant Adjustments.
Responding to the report, Minister for Social Security Ben Macpherson said:
â€œI am pleased that this Audit Scotland report recognises the significant progress we have made in building a new public service from scratch since 2018 and delivering 12 benefits â€“ seven of which are completely new forms of financial support that are not available anywhere else in the UK.
â€œWe have successfully introduced a range of benefits that are now supporting carers and low-income families with their living costs, including with heating and we are helping disabled people to live full and independent lives.
â€œThis year will see us deliver even more for the people of Scotland. Our Scottish Child Payment will be extended to eligible children aged under 16 and be increased to Â£25 per week per child by the end of the year, supporting over 430,000 eligible children; and in winter 2022/23 we will introduce our new winter heating payment for low-income households â€“ a stable Â£50 payment that will support 400,000 low-income households with their heating costs. We will also continue to roll out Adult Disability Payment, our most complex benefit, and significantly progress transferring tens of thousands of Scottish disability benefit cases from the DWP to Social Security Scotland.
â€œI am proud that we have built our social security system with the people who will use it, and appreciate that the report acknowledges our focus has delivered a service built on our principles of dignity, fairness and respect. The report also notes the positive feedback people have shared about their experiences of engaging with Social Security Scotland.
â€œWe have been ambitious in our delivery timeline â€“ including introducing new benefits while dealing with the pandemic â€“ and we are ensuring that we transfer tens of thousands of cases safely and securely from the DWP to Social Security Scotland. As well as delivering benefits now and in the period ahead, we are responsibly and ambitiously developing a new social security system that will serve Scotland for many years to come, putting people at the heart of everything we do.â€

                        Record number of students from deprived areas at university.
                    

The number of Scottish students from deprived areas progressing to Scottish universities is at an all-time high.
The latest statistics show 16.7% of Scottish domiciled full-time first degree students at Scottish universities are from the 20% most deprived areas in the country.
This is an increase from 16.4% in 2019-20 and represents an additional 545 students.
There has also been an increase in the number of students who are care experienced (from 87% in 2019-2020 to 91%) or from a deprived background (from 87.5% in 2019-2020 to 90.2%), returning for their second year.
Higher Education Minister Jamie Hepburn said:
â€œBy 2030, we want 20% of students entering higher education to come from Scotland's most deprived backgrounds.
â€œThese statistics show another step towards that, with a record number of Scottish students from deprived areas enrolling in university for the first time. This highlights the fact that Scotland continues to be an attractive place to study and live for prospective students.
â€œThe Commissioner for Fair Access has previously said that Scotland is â€˜setting the paceâ€™ in the UK in widening participation. We believe every young person should have the opportunity to reach their full potential, no matter their circumstances.â€

                        Â£100 million to cut carbon footprint further.
                    

New funding to help public bodies unlock and realise further investment in measures to improve energy efficiency and install low and zero carbon heat systems in buildings has been launched.
The Scottish Central Government Energy Efficiency Grant scheme will make Â£100 million available during this parliamentary session.
The funding launch coincides with the publication of the latest analysis of public bodiesâ€™ emissions, which shows a 5.8% reduction in reported emissions in 2020/21 compared to the previous year.
Overall public bodiesâ€™ reported emissions have now fallen by a third since reporting began six years ago. Over the same period, emissions generated by electricity use have more than halved across public bodies.
There has been a 64% cut in NHS buildings emissions since 1990, with the Â£10 billion, 10-year NHS capital programme supporting its net zero commitment. Scotlandâ€™s first net-zero hospital, NHS Balfour Hospital, opened in 2019.
Zero Carbon Buildings Minister Patrick Harvie said:
â€œThe ongoing cost of living crisis and energy security issues caused by Russiaâ€™s illegal invasion of Ukraine make the case for pursuing our vision to improve energy efficiency across Scotlandâ€™s homes and buildings, and transition away from high-carbon heating systems, even more compelling.
â€œOur heat in buildings strategy sets our plans for more than 1 million homes and 50,000 non-domestic buildings to be running on low or zero carbon heating systems by 2030. Our support to help property owners and tenants to improve the energy efficiency of their homes and buildings will help to reduce both domestic and non-domestic energy bills while also tackling climate change.
â€œIt is imperative that every sector across Scotland, including public bodies, takes action to meet our climate obligations. The latest analysis shows further positive steps being taken by the public sector, and this funding will help accelerate action in the crucial years ahead while also realising energy savings that can be reinvested into important public services.â€
Background
The Â£100 million Scottish Central Government Energy Efficiency Grant is 2020/21 Programme for Government commitment. Â£15 million of funding is being made available through the scheme in 2022/23. Eligible public bodies, including NHS Boards and colleges, are detailed on the Scottish Government website.
The sixth annual analysis of public bodiesâ€™ statutory climate change report is available on the Sustainable Scotland Network website.
Carbon emissions across Scottish Government operations by fallen by 45% between 2009/10 and 2019/20. It is the first government in the world to hold the Carbon Trust Triple Standard.
NHS Balfour Hospital, is the first to operate as an all-electric acute services healthcare facility. Heating and hot water are provided by twin air source heat pumps. Green electricity is provided by an array of solar photovoltaic cells which powers low energy LED lighting and high frequency low loss fluorescent lighting in clinical areas, with lighting control software managing demand according to occupancy levels. The building fabric and components all contribute to reduced energy demand due to insulation properties, high construction standards and thermal efficiencies            ",5/17/2022,Public bodiesâ€™ emissions reduce

                        Best Start Foods eligibility to widenÂ 
                    

Plans to remove all income thresholds from Best Start Foods by 2023-24 have been announced as part of the second Tackling Child Poverty Delivery Plan, â€˜Best Start, Bright Futuresâ€™.
This will increase eligibility to all people in receipt of a qualifying benefit. As a result, an additional 30,000 people are expected to benefit from Best Start Foods.
Best Start Foods is delivered via a prepaid card and provides Â£18 every four weeks throughout pregnancy, Â£36 every four weeks from birth until a child turns one, then Â£18 every four weeks from one until a child turns three.Â 
The implementation of this change will be part of the successful delivery in the coming years of our significant, wider benefits programme.
Minister for Social Security Ben Macpherson said:
Â â€œTackling child poverty is a national mission for us. We continue to take the necessary steps to reach the ambitious targets set out in our Tackling Child Poverty Delivery Plan. Social security is one of the main pillars of this plan and will help us to Â deliver support directly into the pockets of those families who need it the most.
â€œThe cost of healthy food was already a pressure for parents and carers, and the cost of living increases are only making this more challenging. We will remove the income thresholds for Best Start Foods so that around 30,000 additional people who receive tax credits or certain benefits will be able to receive Best Start Foods by the end of financial year 2023-24.â€
Sharon Hill, the Development Manager ofÂ Mayfield and Easthouses Development Trust, which runs a community pantry in Midlothian serving local people, said:
Â â€œWe have been operating the pantry for less than a year but it is clear that people from all walks of life and backgrounds are looking for ways to cut costsÂ when it comes to doing their essential food shopping.
â€œWe encourage people to ensure that they get all the benefits that are available to them and we welcome any move to open that support up to include more people.
â€œLike many people involved in community pantries and food banks our aim is to help people get to a place where they donâ€™t require these services any more.â€
Background
The Scottish Government replaced the UK Healthy Start Voucher scheme in Scotland with Best Start Foods on 12 August 2019
Best Start Foods aims to help tackle the impacts of child poverty by supporting low income families to buy healthy foods
Best Start Foods is delivered via a prepaid card and provides Â£18 every four weeks throughout pregnancy, Â£36 every four weeks from birth until a child turns one, then Â£18 every four weeks until a child turns three
The card can be used to buy healthy food, including eggs, milk, fruit, vegetables and pulses
Applicants under 18 will be eligible for Best Start Foods during pregnancy and up until their child turns one, without the need to be in receipt of benefits
Applicants over 18 need to be in receipt of a qualifying benefit. At present, income thresholds also apply for some of these qualifying benefits.Â  These income thresholds will be removed by 2023-24
Eligible families, and carers can find out more and apply at mygov.scot/beststart or by calling Social Security Scotland free on 0800 182 2222
Best Start Foods is part of a package of Five Family Payments. By the end of 2022, the Scottish Governmentâ€™s package of Five Family Payments for low income families will be worth up to a maximum of over Â£10,000 by the time a familyâ€™s first child turns 6, and Â£9,700 for second and subsequent children

Young people struggling to access employment will be supported by an additional Â£4 million through the Young Personâ€™s Guarantee.
The funding will help young people impacted most by the pandemic, including those who are care-experienced and those experiencing mental health issues.
Three programmes will share the Â£4 million, which will connect people with employers, training and volunteering opportunities.
Minister for Youth Employment and Training Jamie Hepburn said:
â€œWe want all of our young people to succeed, no matter their background or circumstances. Our aim is to ensure those seeking work have access to valuable support and opportunities for years to come.
â€œWe know that many young people may face additional barriers to successfully gaining permanent work and the uncertainty caused by the pandemic combined with the cost of living crisis has made this more challenging. By connecting young people seeking work directly with employers we can offer them potentially life changing opportunities.
â€œThis additional support is on top of Â£15 million already allocated to local authorities through the Young Personâ€™s Guarantee for the current year and will build on our strong record of tackling youth unemployment.â€
Background:
The Young Person's Guarantee is a commitment to bring together employers, partners and young people. It aims to connect every 16 to 24 year old in Scotland to an opportunity. This could be a job, apprenticeship, further or higher education, training or volunteering.
The Scottish Government has provided significant funds to local authorities for employment support which is used in addition to their own local funding. In 2022-23, almost Â£60 million was provided to help deliver employment support, including Â£15 million for the Young Personâ€™s Guarantee.
This additional Â£4 million funding for the Young Personâ€™s Guarantee will be shared between three programmes:
Inspiring Scotland will receive Â£2.6 million towards their Our Future Now programme which offers young people the opportunity to take part in work placements, shadowing and interview training
The Young Peopleâ€™s Consortium (Action for Children, Barnardoâ€™s and Princeâ€™s Trust) will receive Â£1.4 million to help young people with experience of the care system secure full-time employment
Volunteering Matters, in partnership with the Scottish Association for Mental Health (SAMH), will receive Â£97,000 towards their work to support young people in Glasgow, including those experiencing mental health issues, to gain access to formal volunteering opportunities

                        Public encouraged to complete returns.
                    

Householders across Scotland will be given an extra four weeks to complete their census returns.
Over two million households have already completed the census â€“ more than 77% of the total.
National Records of Scotland (NRS) has offered the extension until the end of May to ensure everyone has the opportunity to complete their return and help shape important services in their community.
Around 68,000 households have begun their census returns online, but have not yet completed them and a similar number of requested paper forms have yet to be returned.
Every household is legally required to complete their returns and Scots are reminded that failing to do so could result in prosecution and a fine of up to Â£1000.
Cabinet Secretary for the Constitution, External Affairs and Culture Angus Robertson said:
â€œThe results of the Census help local authorities, businesses and the government plan a wide range of vital public services to improve the lives of those living and working in Scotland. The census also becomes part of our history.
â€œIt is therefore essential that we take further steps to maximise participation, particularly given the wider challenges people have faced in recent times.
â€œThat is why I am announcing today that National Records of Scotland will now continue to accept census returns until the end of May. This will allow the census collection period to continue for four weeks to give everyone the opportunity to complete Scotlandâ€™s Census, and allow all outstanding returns to be captured so that everyoneâ€™s voice can be heard.
â€œIn addition to being a civic responsibility completion of the census is also a legal responsibility. Failure to meet this responsibility can result in prosecution. However, the shared focus is, and must be, on ensuring that people are supported and encouraged to complete the census.
â€œIt is vital that we secure as high a response rate as possible so that the census can be effective in delivering its many benefits for future public services. For those who have already completed their census, thank you. For those still to do so, I would urge you to act now.â€
Background
An extension to the census collection period remains a legitimate and often used process to facilitate engagement with the census process and has occurred internationally.
Countries including Poland, Japan and the USA have all taken similar steps in recent years to ensure maximum participation. England and Wales also extended their enumeration of some specific communal establishments for a period of 3-4 weeks in their 2021 census.
Help and support to complete the census is available on the Scotlandâ€™s Census website or via a free helpline 0800 030 8308. Paper forms are also still available on request for those who need them.
The 2022 census asks questions on a range of topics, including the types of accommodation people stay in, household relationships, age, sex, health and employment status.
New questions for the 2022 census include use of British Sign Language (BSL), passports held, previous armed forces history and new voluntary questions on sexual orientation and trans status.
Every household in Scotland must complete the census and the answers provide the information needed to make important decisions on funding for services such as education, housing and healthcare.
Extending the census collection period for 4 weeks will cost an additional budget investment this year of up to 7% (Â£9.76 million) of the overall programme costs.            ",4/28/2022,Extension to Scotlandâ€™s Census

Displaced Ukrainian students settling in Scotland will be given access to free tuition and living cost support, subject to parliamentary approval.
Under new proposals from the Scottish Government, Ukrainians wishing to embark on a further or higher education course from academic year 2022-23 will be eligible for free tuition and living cost support, providing they have submitted an application to the Homes for Ukraine, Ukraine Family or the Ukraine Extension schemes.
Existing Ukrainian students who have previously started courses in Scotland and who are experiencing hardship will be eligible to apply for immediate financial assistance through a newly created Â£1 million International Studentsâ€™ Emergency Fund.
Minister for Higher Education and Further Education Jamie Hepburn said:
â€œWe are determined to do everything we can to give displaced people from Ukraine the warmest welcome possible and we want to ensure students arriving here have the support they need to start or continue their higher and further education. Â 
â€œBy extending home fee status and living cost support to students arriving from Ukraine we hope to provide some stability and assurance at this deeply troubling time and ensure those forced to flee their homes can live safely and comfortably in Scotland for as long as they need to.
â€œWe have also created a new Â£1 million International Studentsâ€™ Emergency Fund. This will help Ukrainian students already in Scotland who find themselves in hardship due to their situation, to continue their studies.
â€œEducation opens doors to opportunities and transforms lives for the better so it is absolutely crucial we remove any financial barriers those displaced by the conflict may face.â€ Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â 
Background Â 
The proposals mean a change to the residency criteria in Scotland in the fees and student support regulations will be applied to those individuals who are eligible and have applied to the Homes for Ukraine, Ukraine Family or the Ukraine Extension schemes.
Ukrainian students already undertaking higher or further education courses who apply to the Ukraine Extension scheme will be eligible for support via the International Studentsâ€™ Emergency Fund, should they be facing financial hardship. Those seeking to apply should contact their institution for more information.
The updates to legislation will ensure eligible students can access free tuition and living cost support of up to Â£8,100 per year in the form of bursaries and loans, and those entering college in further education are eligible for bursary and grants of up to Â£4,668 each year.
Regulations are due to be laid in parliament in early May. Subject to Parliamentary approval, they will come into force on 1 August 2022, which is the first day of the 2022-23 academic year.
Higher and Further Education Minister Jamie Hepburn has signed a joint letter with members of the European Higher Education Area, condemning the invasion of Ukraine and committing, with partners across Europe, to supporting Ukrainian students.

Thousands of families are saving around Â£4,900 annually thanks to funded Early Learning and Childcare (ELC) from the Scottish Government.
The latest figures show that 111,574 children were in funded ELC places at the end of January 2022 -Â an increase of 20,684 (23%), since August 2021.
Of these, 88% (97,887 children) were taking advantage of the full offer of 1,140 hours of funded ELC a year. The total saving to families from the 1,140 hours offer is estimated to be Â£4,900 per child per annum.
Childrenâ€™s Minister Clare Haughey said:
â€œItâ€™s fantastic to see so many families accessing funded ELC and making significant savings â€“ particularly at a time when so many are struggling with cost of living increases.
â€œAs well as saving families money, funded ELC brings real benefits for children. Providing access to free, high-quality early learning and childcare enriches childrenâ€™s early years and provides them with skills and confidence for starting school and beyond. It also supports parentsâ€™ ability to work, train or study.â€

A new report estimates 70,000Â people in Scotland, including 30,000 children, would be lifted out of poverty by 2024 if UK Government welfare reforms introduced since 2015 were reversed.
The cost of reversing changes, including the removal of the Â£20 per week Universal Credit uplift and the two child benefit cap would be around Â£780 million a year, according to estimates in the Scottish Governmentâ€™s Welfare Reform - Impact on Families with Children report.
Last month the Scottish Government published its second Tackling Child Poverty Delivery Plan â€“ Best Start, Bright Futures â€“ which sets out immediate and longer term actions to support people out of poverty and to tackle its deep-seated causes.
Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison said:
â€œTackling child poverty is our national mission and we are helping to lift thousands of children out of poverty in Scotland within our limited powers. This report lays bare the cost of repeated UK Government welfare reforms since 2015 and the challenge we face in lifting children and families out of poverty for good.
â€œWe are determined to tackle the cost of living crisis and weâ€™re already helping to lift thousands of children out of poverty. We invested almost Â£6 billion from 2018-21 to support low income households, including around Â£2.18 billion to directly support children. We are also taking steps to mitigate the impact of the UK Governmentâ€™s bedroom tax and benefit cap as fully as we can within our limited powers.
â€œWe have introduced a package of five family benefits, including the Scottish Child Payment that we will raise to Â£25 a week by the end of 2022. We are also investing in employment support for parents, through new skills and training opportunities and key worker support to help reduce household costs and drive longer term change.â€
Background
Welfare Reform - Impact on Families with Children report
Best Start, Bright Futures: tackling child poverty delivery plan 2022 to 2026
The study found:
Reversing key UK Government welfare reforms that have occurred since 2015 would bring an estimated 70,000 people out of poverty in Scotland, including 30,000 children, in 2023-24.
The total cost of reversing these reforms would be around Â£780 million per annum, including Â£50 million in increased expenditure on existing benefits provided by the Scottish Government such as the Scottish Child Payment and Discretionary Housing Payments, as a result of increased eligibility for these benefits.
Reversing the reforms would increase disposable income for households with children with the lowest 10% of incomes by around 11%, and for households in poverty with children by 10%.
Reversing each of the removal of the Â£20 uplift, the benefit freeze, or the two-child limit and removal of the family element, Â in isolation, would bring around 10,000 children out of poverty: Of the reforms modelled, the most cost-effective way to reduce child poverty would be to reverse the two-child limit and the removal of the family element at a cost of Â£120 million.
The Scottish Government has published a series of reports on the impacts of UK Government welfare reform in Scotland since 2014.

The flagship family payment â€“ Scottish Child Payment â€“ has now doubled to Â£20 per week per child. 104,000 children are already benefiting from this increase.
The payment, which is unique to Scotland, was designed to tackle child poverty head on. It is one of five family benefits which provides financial support to low income families with children aged under 6.
The benefit will be extended at the end of the year to all eligible children under the age of 16 - and at that point also increase further from Â£20 to Â£25.
Once extended, it is expected over 400,000 children could be eligible. The newly doubled Scottish Child Payment, together with the three Best Start Grant payments and Best Start Foods, will provide families with more than Â£10,000 by the time their first child turns 6 and Â£9,700 for subsequent children. This compares to less than Â£1,800 for an eligible familyâ€™s first child in England and Wales, and less than Â£1,300 for subsequent children.
Visiting Glasgow based family charity Govan Help, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:
â€œWe are using our social security powers to take immediate steps to put cash in the pockets of families by doubling the Scottish Child Payment to Â£20 per week per child â€“ support not replicated anywhere else in the UK.
â€œThis is a key part of our national mission to tackle child poverty. We will further increase this payment to Â£25 by the end of 2022 â€“ five times the amount campaigners originally asked. This will gives families additional financial support of Â£1,300 for each eligible child every year. We will back this with investment of around Â£671 million over the next two years â€“ just part of our package of support for families.
â€œOur Tackling Child Poverty Delivery Plan will also build on our investment in employment support for parents, through new skills and training opportunities and key worker support to help reduce household costs and drive longer term change.
â€œWe are determined to give children the best start and a bright future by putting more money into the pockets of those who need it most. Increasing the Scottish Child Payment will make a real difference to families and help to build a more equal and fairer Scotland for everyone.â€
Viv Sawers, Chief Officer at Govan Help, said:
â€œThis is a fantastic measure from Scottish Government in tackling Child Poverty in Scotland. The roll out and the uplift in Scottish Child Payment will have an incredible impact on the families across Scotland who need it most and we are delighted to see money going directly to families who we know are struggling to meet their basic cost of living.Â Â 
â€œGovan has higher than average rates of Child Poverty so this will have a hugely positive impact on the quality of life for families in this local community. We see families struggling daily, they have told us what a difference this has made already with the cost of living increases, we look forward to supporting more families to access this as it rolls out to children up to age 16 later this year. We know parenting is a really hard job, without financial pressures, this funding will go a long way to removing stresses that can impact onÂ  healthy family functioning and wellbeing.â€

Child poverty in Scotland is projected to fall to its lowest level in nearly 30 years as a result of the actions taken to date and commitments in the second Tackling Child Poverty Delivery Plan.
More than 60,000 fewer children could be living in relative poverty in 2023 compared to 2017, according to updated modelling.
Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison said a focus on long-term parental employment opportunities, strengthened social security and support to reduce household costs are at the heart of the new four year delivery plan, Best Start, Bright Futures.
In 2022-23 this work will be supported by investment of almost Â£113 million on top of funding already allocated to ongoing programmes.
Actions include:
Significantly increasing employment services with the aim of supporting up to 12,000 parents to enter and progress in sustainable and fair work through actions taken over the life of the Plan, with initial investment of up to Â£81 million in 2022-23 in employability support for parents
Increasing Scottish Child Payment from Â£20 to Â£25 when the benefit is extended to under 16s by the end of 2022. This means Â£1,300 of support per eligible child per year. It is five times more than originally asked for by campaigners and an investment of Â£671 million over the next two years
Delivering a new Parental Transition Fund to tackle the financial barriers parents face in entering the labour market, particularly over the initial period of employment, with an investment of up to Â£15 million each year
Taking immediate steps to mitigate the UK Governmentâ€™s Benefit Cap as fully as possible within devolved powers, through Discretionary Housing Payments. This will support our priority families, in particular, who are disproportionately impacted by this policy
Ms Robison said:
â€œI am proud that our actions of the past four years, together with those set out in this plan, are projected to deliver the lowest level of child poverty in Scotland in 30 years.
â€œWe are taking immediate steps to put cash in the pockets of families â€“ tackling the cost of living crisis and helping to lift thousands of children out of poverty in Scotland.
â€œOur package of five family benefits for low income families, including the increased Scottish Child Payment, will be worth over Â£10,000 by the time a familyâ€™s first child turns 6, and Â£9,700 for second and subsequent children.
â€œThat is a difference of more than Â£8,200 for every eligible child born in Scotland in comparison to England and Wales â€“ highlighting the unparalleled support offered by this government to children across the early years.
â€œWe will also build on our investment in employment support for parents, through new skills and training opportunities and key worker support to help reduce household costs and drive longer term change.
â€œOur national mission to tackle child poverty is already giving more children the best start and a bright future. We are determined to meet our ambitious targets set for 2023-24 and 2030 and beyond, so that no children in Scotland are living in poverty. We know there is not a silver bullet and this cannot be done overnight.â€
Scottish Government Minister and Scottish Green Party Co-Leader Patrick Harvie said:
â€œThis plan delivers on key commitments to tackle child poverty and inequality in the cooperation agreement between the Scottish Government and the Scottish Green Party.
â€œWe welcome the actions being taken, particularly in mitigating the UK Government benefit cap and increasing the Scottish Child Payment which will provide major support to thousands of low income households.â€

Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison statement to parliament on Tackling Child Poverty Delivery Plan 2022-26
Other actions in the plan to provide immediate support and break the cycle of poverty include:
Enhancing â€˜benefit in kindâ€™ offers to parents around childcare, digital connectivity and transport to help increase employment opportunities and ease cost of living pressures
Investing up to Â£5 million to identify a small number of Pathfinder areas in Scotland, working with partners to help support individual family needs
Introducing reforms to improve quality and affordability in the rented sector, continuing to invest in affordable housing and working with housing associations to break the cycle of homelessness
The Scottish Governmentâ€™s package of five family benefits for low income families, including the increased Scottish Child Payment, will be worth over Â£10,000 by the time a familyâ€™s first child turns 6, and Â£9,700 for second and subsequent children. This compares to less than Â£1,800 for an eligible familyâ€™s first child in England and Wales, and less than Â£1,300 for second and subsequent children.
Relative child poverty in Scotland was 24% in 2017-18, with an estimated 230,000 children living in poverty in that year. Current projections suggest 17% of children will be living in relative poverty in 2023-24, approximately 170,000, one percentage point below the statutory target of 18%.
The Child Poverty (Scotland) Act 2017 sets in statute four ambitious interim targets to be met in 2023-24, with final targets to be met by 2030. These are that:
Fewer than 18% of children living in families in relative poverty in 2023-24, reducing to fewer than 10% by 2030.
Fewer than 14% of children living in families in absolute poverty in 2023-24, reducing to fewer than 5% by 2030.
Fewer than 8% of children living in families living in combined low income and material deprivation in 2023-24, reducing to fewer than 5% by 2030.
Fewer than 8% of children living in families in persistent poverty in 2023-24, reducing to fewer than 5% by 2030.
Child poverty projections are based on the UKMOD microsimulation model, which is maintained, developed, and managed by the Centre for Microsimulation and Policy Analysis (CeMPA) at the University of Essex.
The model applies the rules of the tax and benefit system to a set of data based on the Family Resources Survey. This data is combined with economic forecasts, mainly from the Office for Budget Responsibility, to project incomes into future years. Estimated poverty rates are calibrated to the latest year of official poverty statistics. All modelling results rely on a range of assumptions and are subject to a degree of uncertainty, particularly when projecting into future years.

Â 
The UK Government has not delivered the support and help that families and businesses need today, according to Finance Secretary Kate Forbes.
Responding to the Spring Statement, Ms Forbes said the Chancellor failed to help thousands of worried households facing poverty as a result of soaring energy bills and a cost of living crisis.
In 2018/19, the Scottish Government introduced a more progressive approach to tax, including a 19% starter rate band below the basic rate, ensuring those who can afford to pay a little more do so.
Ms Forbes said:
â€œThe Spring Statement has failed to address the biggest challenges facing households today. With soaring energy bills and a cost of living crisis, the Chancellor has not used his Spring Statement sufficiently to provide lifeline support that could prevent households facing fuel poverty.
â€œThe Scottish Government is providing a further Â£10 million to continue our Fuel Insecurity Fund into 2022-23, which supports people struggling with their energy bills. Most powers relating to the energy markets remain reserved and Scottish Ministers have repeatedly called for the UK Government to urgently take further action to support households - including a reduction in VAT on household energy bills and support for those on low incomes.
â€œWe are doing all we can to tackle the cost of living crisis - including doubling the Scottish Child Payment from Â£10 per week per eligible child to Â£20 next month. The UK Government should have followed our lead and matched the 6% uprate on social security benefits which the Scottish Government is adding to eight of the benefits we deliver. The Chancellor failed to match that commitment which could have provided lifeline support to thousands of households.
â€œOn taxation, we have already acted to introduce a 19% starter rate of income tax below the basic rate, in line with our commitment to progressive taxation, which makes Scotland the fairest taxed part of the UK. We will continue to take that approach when we set taxation policy in future budgets.â€
Background
In her letter to the Chancellor, the Finance Secretary called for the UK Government to deliver:
more targeted funding to business sectors directly affected by the Ukraine conflict
relief to business on National Insurance contributions
the removal of VAT from energy efficient and zero emission heat equipment and products
greater powers for the Scottish Government to implement flexible working, to get more people into jobs
increased benefits at a higher rate, closer to inflation
removal/reduction of VAT on household energy bills
two extra Cold Weather Payments â€“ one immediately and another in winter 2022-23 when energy bills will have risen again
The Scottish Government will set out its plans on income tax and tax policies in future budgets. There are currently no changes to income tax rates or bands.

The UK Government must take bold and decisive action to help protect people from soaring living costs, according to Finance Secretary Kate Forbes.
Speaking ahead of the Spring Statement, Ms Forbes said the Chancellor of the Exchequer must use every tool available to provide support through what is expected to be a turbulent period of economic uncertainty.
Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said:
â€œThis is not a time to be ducking the considerable challenges we face, and I expect the Chancellor to use the Spring Statement to outline significant actions to support households and businesses, considering that most of the relevant powers are reserved to the UK Government.
â€œThe Scottish Government is doing all it can to help those most in need. We are uprating eight Scottish benefits by 6% from 1 April as well as doubling our Scottish Child Payment to Â£20 per week per eligible child. I call again on the UK Government to follow our lead and uprate social security benefits by 6%.â€

provide powers to implement flexible working, to get more people into jobs

                        Supporting low income households.
                    

Almost Â£6 billion has been invested to support low income households across Scotland over the last three years.
More than a third of that total, around Â£2.18 billion, has directly benefitted children as the Scottish Government prepares to publish its Tackling Child Poverty Delivery Plan for 2022-2026.
On Thursday (24 March) Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison will update Parliament on the national mission to break the cycle of poverty for thousands of families.
The Delivery Plan for 2022-26 builds on the work of â€˜Every Child, Every Chanceâ€™, published in 2018. It introduced a range of new supports through Social Security Scotland, including the Scottish Child Payment and Best Start Grants, and employability services such as Fair Start Scotland.
Ms Robison said:
â€œIn the face of UK government austerity, combined with the deeply damaging Â£20 cut to Universal Credit, our investment over the last four years to support low income families has had a significant impact. But there is still more we must do to deliver the transformational changes we all want to see.
â€œOur second Tackling Child Poverty Delivery Plan will be a plan for all of Scotland. All parts of society have a role to play in our national mission to end child poverty. This is a collective effort across society to deliver for our future generations and break the cycle of poverty once and for all.
â€œOur ambitious measures are already delivering considerable support to children and families compared with other parts of the UK - for example, through free childcare and employment support, maximising incomes and affordable housing and, of course, social security.
â€œWe remain the only part of the UK to have five family benefits, including the Scottish Child Payment, which was designed to tackle child poverty head on. Combined with our three Best Start Grants and Best Start Foods, low income families receive up to Â£8,400 of financial support by the time their first child turns six.
â€œOur budgets may be fixed, powers limited, and the scale of the challenge as we emerge from the pandemic has increased. However, we are determined to do everything within our powers to give the children of Scotland the opportunities they deserve to succeed.â€
Background
The Child Poverty (Scotland) Act 2017 set four ambitious income-based child poverty targets to be met by 2030/31, with interim targets set for 2023/24.Â 
A breakdown of the investment across the first three years (2018-21) of Every Child, Every Chance, the Scottish Governmentâ€™s first Tackling Child Poverty Delivery Plan, is set out below with links to further detail:
2018-19: Â£1.412 billion to support low income households, of which over Â£527 million directly benefitted low income families with children â€“ set out in Tackling Child Poverty: First Year Progress Report (2018-19)
2019-20: Â£1.966 billion to support low income households, of which Â£672 million directly benefitted low income families with children â€“ set out in Tackling Child Poverty: Second Year Progress Report (2019-20)
2020-21: Â£2.499 billion to support low income households, of which Â£978 million directly benefitted low income families with children â€“ set out in Tackling Child Poverty: Third Year Progress Report (2020-21)
Estimates of spend in relation to 2021-22 will be published as part of the Fourth Year Progress Report by the end of June 2022.
The recent â€˜Cost of a Child in Scotlandâ€™ report from the Child Poverty Action Group also highlighted the impact of Scottish Government support for families compared to the rest of the UK. It estimated Scottish Government policies will reduce the net cost of bringing up a child by 31 per cent, almost Â£24,000, once Scottish Child Payment is doubled and the expansion of free school meals is delivered.
The Scottish Government is also supporting families with the rising cost of living through its Â£41 millionÂ Winter Support FundÂ andÂ Â£290 million package of measuresÂ including Â£150 for all households in receipt of Council Tax Reduction and those in Council Tax bands A-D. Last week, benefits rises of 6 per cent were announced to help with cost of living pressures and devolved employment support programmes are key to delivering fair work and pay.
The Scottish Child Payment will double to Â£20 per week from April â€“ four times more than campaigners originally asked for. The Scottish Government is providing immediate support to over 144,000 school-age children through Bridging Payments. They are worth Â£520 this year, ahead of the extension of the Scottish Child Payment to under 16s by the end of the year.
Scotland has led the way with affordable housing across the UK, delivering 105,755 affordable homes since 2007, over 73,000 of which were for social rent. We are committed to delivering 110,000 affordable homes by 2032, of which at least 70% will be available for social rent.            ",3/21/2022,Investment in tackling child poverty

                        Finance Secretary writes to Treasury ahead of Spring Statement.
                    

Â People and businesses need urgent UK Government support to mitigate the rising cost of living, Finance Secretary Kate Forbes has said.
In a letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak ahead of the Spring Statement, Ms Forbes called on UK Ministers to match the 6% uprate on social security benefits which the Scottish Government is delivering on eight of the benefits it delivers, and for further payments to be made to low income households through the Cold Weather Payment
The letter to the UK Government also calls for:
more targeted funding to business sectors directly affected by the conflict in Ukraine
relief to business on National Insurance Contributions
the removal of VAT from energy efficient and zero emission heat equipment and products
greater powers for the Scottish Government to work with employers to implement flexible working
full replacement of EU funding lost to Scotland as a result of Brexit, as promised by the UK Government
The Scottish Government stands ready to work with the UK Government, which holds the powers to tackle the most pressing issues, to put a package of support in place.
Ms Forbes said:
â€œIn Scotland we are doing all we can to ensure people, communities and businesses are given as much support as possible to deal with the rising cost of living and the potential economic implications of Russiaâ€™s illegal invasion of Ukraine.
â€œHowever, many of the powers required to really tackle these issues are reserved to the UK Government, which is why I am calling on the Chancellor to take much needed action in his Spring Statement.
â€œThe Scottish Government is uprating eight Scottish benefits by 6% from 1 April as well as doubling our Scottish Child Payment from Â£10 per week per eligible child to Â£20. We are using our powers to help those who need us most in these difficult times and it is time for the UK Government to follow our lead and uprate social security benefits by 6%.
â€œI would also ask for further immediate support to be delivered through the Cold Weather Payment, with an additional payment now and another next winter when we know energy bills will have risen again.â€

Eight Scottish social security benefits will be increased by 6% from 1 April.
Social Security Minister Ben Macpherson has announced the rise in support for low income households and carers in light of the increasing cost of living pressures.
Benefits and assistance including Job Start Payment, Young Carerâ€™s Grant, Funeral Support, three Best Start Grants and Carerâ€™s Allowance Supplement were due to be uprated by 3.1% for 2022/23. Subject to parliamentary approval, the increases will now be almost doubled to a 6% uprate.
Ministers have already announced that Scottish Child Payment will double from Â£10 per week to Â£20 from 1 April, a 100% increase, while Best Start Foods rose from Â£4.25 to Â£4.50 a week in August (5.88%). Child Winter Heating Assistance, which was previously set to rise by 5%, will now also rise by 6%.
Mr Macpherson said:
â€œWe are acting urgently in response to growing pressures on the costs of living, which were already rising and have now increased significantly again due to the illegal war in Ukraine.
â€œWe will provide additional support as quickly as possible by further increasing several forms of devolved social security benefits and assistance - enhancing our planned 3.1% uprating to a 6% rise - and this will be implemented in just over two weeksâ€™ time.
â€œThe Scottish Government is determined to use the powers we have to move at pace to help those who need assistance most in these challenging times. The benefits we are uprating will support those on low incomes, particularly families and unpaid carers.â€
Background
Adult Disability Payment and Child Disability Payment will still increase by 3.1% in line with the equivalent benefits (Disability Living Allowance and Personal Independence Payment) which are still administered by DWP under agency agreement. This is to avoid creating a two-tier system where individuals paid by Social Security Scotland are paid more than clients whose cases have not yet transferred to the Scottish system.
The Scottish Government is supporting families with the rising cost of living through its Â£41 millionÂ Winter Support FundÂ andÂ Â£290 million package of measuresÂ including Â£150 for all households in receipt of Council Tax Reduction and those in Council Tax bands A-D andÂ devolved employment support programmes.

Support is being expanded to improve the energy efficiency of homes and tackle energy costs. Â 
In response to the cost of living crisis, three key Scottish Government energy efficiency and heat programmes will be boosted from April.
These include:
Expanding the Home Energy Scotland (HES) advice service, which provides free, impartial advice available to all households in Scotland on making homes warmer, greener and easier to heat. Capacity will be increased by 20% to support an extra 12,000 households a year, whilst a service offering bespoke advice to the most vulnerable households will be doubled.
Widening the eligibility criteria of the Scottish Governmentâ€™s flagship Warmer Homes Scotland fuel poverty programme to include more groups within the 60 â€“ 75 years age range.
Increasing the level of funding individual fuel poor households could benefit from through the local authority-led Area Based Schemes.
More than Â£160 million of funding is being invested this year to help make Scotlandâ€™s homes and buildings warmer and more efficient, supporting efforts to tackle fuel poverty whilst helping householders manage their energy bills and reduce carbon emissions.
Zero Carbon Buildings Minister Patrick Harvie said:
â€œEveryone needs a safe, warm place to call home. I am acutely aware that soaring energy prices will be causing many people to worry about the cost of their fuel bills and it is vital that people struggling with energy bills get the information and support they need, while governments step up with appropriate actions.
â€œWe are using all powers and resources available to us to support people through the cost of living crisis and the Scottish Budget last month included a package of measures to provide immediate help with rising bills. At the same time, powers relating to energy markets remain reserved and we have repeatedly called for the UK Government to urgently take further, tangible actions to support households.
â€œHowever, immediate help also has to go side by side with longer term action. Investing in energy efficiency is the best buffer against the ebb and flow of global energy prices.Â  That is why we are boosting energy efficiency programmes today and over the whole parliamentary term.â€
Background
Householders can access free and impartial support through Home Energy Scotland to improve the energy efficiency of their homes. Home Energy Scotland can be contacted on their freephone number 0808 808 2282 or via the Home Energy Scotland website.Â 
Through Scottish Government investment, over 150,000 households now live in homes which are warmer and cheaper to heat, with households saving an estimated Â£936 million pounds on their fuel bills over the lifetime of these improvements, with a total reduction in carbon emissions of 3.4 million tonnes.
Â£50 million is being invested in 2021-22 in Warmer Homes Scotland, the Scottish Government scheme helping households in fuel poverty make their homes warmer and more affordable to heat
Â£64 million is being invested this year in Area Based Schemes, targeting communities blighted by fuel poverty and improving energy efficiency, reducing costs and carbon emissions from heating their homes.
The Home Energy Scotland Loan and Cashback Scheme currently enables homeowners to apply for up to Â£7,500 in cashback if they take out a loan to install green heating systems, such as a heat pump, as well as up to Â£6,000 towards eligible energy efficiency measures to reduce poor energy efficiency.
As part of a wider Â£290 million package of funding announcements made to tackle the cost of living crisis, in 2022-23 the Scottish Government will commit a further Â£10 million to continue the Fuel Insecurity Fund. The fund has helped households at risk of self-disconnection, or self-rationing their energy use, since late 2020.            ",3/12/2022,Tackling the cost of living crisis

                        Banning the destruction of unsold goods could support a circular economy.
                    

The destruction of unsold, durable goods could be banned as part of plans to reduce waste, Circular Economy Minister Lorna Slater has announced.
Proposals for a ban will be put forward in a consultation on a new Circular Economy Bill, to be published in May.
It is intended to address public concerns about unsold products being destroyed or ending up in landfill. Retailers may be required to look for other options for unsold products, including donating and recycling them.
The proposals would make sure Scotland keeps pace with Europe as France has recently enacted such a ban and the EU is currently considering similar interventions.
To mark the announcement, the Minister will visit Fresh Start in Edinburgh. The charity distributes essential household goods and white goods donated by retailers as part of their work to help people who have been homeless establish themselves in their new home.
Circular Economy Minister Lorna Slater said:
""It is absolutely senseless for perfectly good products to end up in landfill. Rather than being wasted in landfill or incinerated, they should be reused or repurposed.Â Organisations like Fresh Start show that there is a real need for items like these, and with the cost of living increasing this need is growing rapidly.
""We are living in a climate emergency. When goods go to landfill without having even been used once, we don't just waste the product â€“ we also waste all the energy and raw materials that went into making it.
â€œThis proposal is a direct response to the public concerns about what happens to items that go unsold. By pursuing a ban, we can make sure they make it into the hands of those that need them, and help Scotland reduce its carbon footprint.
""This is the sort of action that's needed to create a circular economy and shows the level of ambition that will be contained in our proposals in May.""
Michael Cook, CEO of Circular Communities Scotland said:
â€œWe are delighted a timetable has been set for consulting on the Circular Economy Bill and look forward to working with Scottish Government to deliver as ambitious a bill as possible. We have been campaigning for a ban on companies destroying products which could easily be repurposed for some time and, therefore, welcome, and fully support this proposal.
â€œCircular Communities Scotland represents a range of impressive charities and social enterprises providing a whole variety of creative alternatives for materials considered waste or surplus. This bill validates their significant contribution towards establishing a more circular economy in Scotland.""
Background
The Circular Economy Bill consultation will launch in May, alongside a consultation on new measures to achieve Scotland's 2025 waste and recycling targets.
A circular economy is a key component of the Scottish Government's response to the climate crisis, aiming to reduce waste and keep products and materials in use for as long as possible.
The EUâ€™s Circular Economy Action Plan identifies a range of potential legislative measures relating to the impact and design of sustainable products, including measures to ban the destruction of unsold durable goods.
France has already introduced a ban on companies destroying clothes, cosmetics, hygiene products, electrical items and other unsold or returned items. Rather than landfill or incinerate unsold goods, companies have to reuse, donate or recycle their unsold products.            ",3/11/2022,Reducing waste

                        Consultation finds â€˜almost unanimousâ€™ support for care home visit rights.
                    

Consultation on plans to introduce Anneâ€™s Law has found overwhelming support for care home residents to have a legal right to be visited by loved ones.
An independent analysis of the consultation found those who responded were â€œalmost unanimouslyâ€ in agreement with the proposal.
Care home residents and those with a friend or relative in a care home shared moving stories of the emotional cost and loss they had experienced due to restrictions on visiting introduced to reduce the risk of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The consultation also found widespread support for plans to strengthen the Health and Social Care Standards to help care home residents to maintain connections with family and friends while Anneâ€™s Law is put in place.
The Scottish Government is already working closely with care home providers to promote the aims of Anneâ€™s Law by upholding current guidance, which states that visiting should be supported even during outbreaks, unless in exceptional circumstances.
Minister for Social Care Kevin Stewart said:
â€œI understand the distress caused by protections which were introduced to help limit the risk of COVID-19 infections in our care homes, which in some cases led to people being unable to be with loved ones for prolonged periods.
â€œWhile it was vital we took steps to protect people living in care homes, I also understand why many residents and those close to them feel there should be a right to visits from designated loved ones in future.
â€œVisits from loved ones have many benefits for residents,Â  improving their quality of life and mental, emotional and physical health and well-being. Family members can often help in providing aspects of peopleâ€™s care and support.
â€œI am extremely grateful to everyone who took the time to submit a response to the consultation. The views of those who responded are now helping to shape the new Standards and the legislation, work on which is well underway.
â€œWe are about to update and strengthen the Health and Social Care Standards, with a strong emphasis on helping residents and their families remain connected.
â€œWhile Anneâ€™s Law will be introduced to Parliament as soon as is practically possible, we are taking immediate action to ensure that care home residents and their families can benefit from its aims and principles right now.â€Â Â 
Background:
More than 400 responses were received to the two part consultation on Anneâ€™s Law and strengthening the Health and Social Care standards.
Responses came from individuals and from organisations including care home providers, health and social care partnerships, local authorities, care home provider representative groups, professional representative organisations, academics, third sector organisations, and family representative groups

                        Financial lifeline for students.
                    

Students facing financial hardship due to the cost of living crisis and rising energy costs can apply for more support.
This week more than Â£5 million has been distributed to help Higher Education students in financial hardship with basics like heating and other household costs. This is part of a Â£37 million hardship funding provided by the Scottish Government since June 2021.
The Scottish Funding Council (SFC) will meet collegesâ€™ Further Education student support funding requirements, and have also provided a further Â£6 million for financial support for FE students, in this academic year.
Higher and Further Education Minister Jamie Hepburn has written to college and university principals, asking them to encourage students most in need to apply and to prioritise allocation of funding.
To further support students, Mr Hepburn has announced:
a Â£350 loan uplift for 2022-23 in higher education. This means that the most disadvantaged students can access Â£8,100 per year through bursary and loan
the introduction of a new 12 monthly payment option in 2022-23 for higher education students receiving the Care Experienced Bursary, so support is also available over the summer months
Mr Hepburn said:
â€œMany students are facing higher energy bills and increased financial hardship as a result of the cost of living crisis.
â€œI have written to university and college principals asking them to ensure that discretionary funds remain accessible for students most in need and that in distributing funds, they should take account of the impact rising energy prices will be having on students, particularly those in private rented accommodation.
â€œI have also asked them to add students facing rising energy bills to the priority groups so they can access the funds. Students can also apply for support through the Fuel Insecurity Fund, which is distributed through third sector organisations.â€
Background
An instalment of Â£5.2 million has been issued to the sector from the 2021-22 Higher Education Discretionary Funds. At the most recent analysis of funds earlier this year, around Â£15 million of funds remain from the first instalment of the HE Discretionary Fund and the Coronavirus Fund, issued at the start of the academic year.Â 
The SFC notified colleges last week as part of the in-year redistribution (IYR) of FE student support funds that colleges demands for funds for the remainder of Academic Year 2021/22 will be met in full.Â  In addition, SFC are repurposing student support funds that were unspent in 2020-21 to give a further allocation of Â£6.375 million to colleges in AY 2021-22.Â  This ensures that discretionary fund support also remains available for FE students experiencing hardship.

                        Funding announced to help tackle the cost of living crisis.
                    

The 2022-2023 Scottish Budget Bill has been backed by MSPs.
During the Stage 3 debate in the Scottish Parliament, Finance Secretary Kate Forbes announcedÂ a further Â£290 million in financial support to help address the rising cost of living.
Ms Forbes said that while the Scottish Government is awaiting final confirmation from the Treasury on funding allocations, the Â£290 million for Scotland announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer last week is not likely to mean net additional funding. This is due to an expected reduction of a similar amount in other consequential funding previously anticipated through the forthcoming UK Government Supplementary Estimates.
Despite these budget pressures and existing support in place to help people, Scottish Ministers have honoured the commitment to allocate Â£290 million to help tackle the cost of living crisis and are going further to ensure those hardest hit have support. New measures announced include: Â 
Â£280 million to provide Â£150 to every household in receipt of Council Tax Reduction in any Band and to provide Â£150 to all other occupied households in Bands A to D. This means 1.85 million households, or 73% of all households, will receive financial support through their council tax bill or a direct payment
Â£10 million in 2022-23 to continue the Fuel Insecurity Fund to help households from rationing their energy use
This is in addition to the Â£120 million previously announced for local government in 2022-23.
A further Â£39.5 million has also been allocated to businesses from the Â£375 million of Omicron business support funding for the current financial year. Following consultation with businesses, who asked for financial support to now focus on economic recovery, this funding will help support local economies and cities continue their economic recovery and help build a more resilient economy. Funding allocated includes:
Â£16 million for culture and major events
Â£7.5 million to support inbound tour operators
Â£6.5 million to support the childcare sector
Â£3.5 million for outbound travel agents
Â£3 million for city centre recovery
Â£3 million to help digitalise SMEs to increase competitiveness, productivity and drive growth
Ms Forbes said:
â€œLarge rises in energy bills, increased costs on every day essentials, rising interest rates and the UK Governmentâ€™s new National Insurance hike are causing huge concern and worry, and people are struggling. These additional costs will hit the most vulnerable in our society, the hardest.
â€œThat is why we will honour our commitment, whatever other Budget challenges we face, to pass on the full Â£290 million to help families now. I am therefore today announcing that there will be three elements to the package of support today.
â€œFirstly, we will provide Â£150 to every household in receipt of Council Tax Reduction in all Council Tax bands. The Council Tax Reduction Scheme already identifies households in greatest need and will allow us to target this intervention.
â€œSecondly, I will provide local authorities with funding to pass on Â£150 to other occupied household in Bands A to D in Scotland. Â In total, combining these elements, 1.85 million, or 73% of all households, will receive Â£150 of support. I know that the cost of living crisis is affecting households who are not in receipt of benefits, who are not claiming a Council Tax Reduction. And they are facing hardship too. We must seek to do what we can to prevent those households and families on the edge of the poverty line, from falling over it.
â€œThirdly I am also announcing Â£10 million in 2022-23 to continue our Fuel Insecurity Fund to help households at risk of self-disconnection, or self-rationing their energy use, due to unaffordable fuel costs.
â€œHouseholds across Scotland, across the UK, are struggling with the wide range of rising costs and many of the macro levers, for example, around energy regulation reside with the UK Government. That is why I will be writing to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, again highlighting that we must work together urgently so we can use our joint powers to do more to tackle the cost of living.â€
BACKGROUND
The additional Â£290 million package announced today for 2022-23 will be given effect via in-year budget revisions.
Households will receive a singular payment - households receiving Council Tax Reduction will receive payment irrelevant of their Band and for those who pay regular Council Tax, eligible households in Bands A to D will receive payment.

                        Clarity needed on Barnett consequentials.
                    

During a session of the Joint Executive Committee (JEC) with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke, Finance Secretary Kate Forbes outlined some of the challenges needing to be addressed as part of the forthcoming joint review of the Scottish Fiscal Framework.
Chairing the meeting in London, Ms Forbes highlighted the need for further collaboration on fiscal flexibility, including consideration of further financial powers as part of the forthcoming Fiscal Framework review.
The meeting follows the UK Governmentâ€™s Council Tax Energy Rebate announcement and the consequential funding for the Scottish Government.
The Spring Budget Revision has also been published showing that the Scottish Government has spent almost Â£15 billion on measures to respond to COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic. It represents the final decisions made in the Scottish Government budget allocations for this financial year despite the challenges due to late notification of consequentials. Â Â 
Speaking following the JEC, Ms Forbes said:
â€œI have had a constructive conversation with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury this afternoon, where there was a frank exchange of views on what is quickly required from the Fiscal Framework Review and the need for further fiscal flexibility for Scotland.
â€œOur experiences of dealing with both the health and economic impacts of the pandemic and supporting those struggling with the cost of living crisis clearly demonstrate how difficult it is to take actions we deem vital without sufficient fiscal powers and often with late notice or lack of engagement when further funding is coming.
â€œThis has been proven once again today. Whilst I will always welcome funding, the net change to our budget isnâ€™t clear yetÂ  â€“ we are awaiting urgent clarity on this from the Treasury and how it will impact our final settlement for the current year.
â€œAs the First Minister has said, we will pass on the full consequential funding to support people struggling with the current costs of living. Council Tax is already lower in Scotland and our current support such as the single Council Tax Reduction Scheme protects 470,000 lower income households.â€
Background
Spring Budget Revision 2021-22 supporting document - gov.scot (www.gov.scot)
Council Tax is higher in England with support for low income households fragmented and subjected to big cuts, resulting in households falling into debt and sizeable increases in the amount of council tax going uncollected.
The single Council Tax Reduction Scheme has maintained support since the abolition of Council Tax benefit in 2013 and Scottish Government funding for it has exceeded local authority costs by over Â£97 million over the past five years.            ",2/3/2022,Further talks on fiscal reform

                        Additional Â£120 million follows funding assurance.
                    

An amendment will be brought forward during Stage 2 of the Budget Bill to allocate an additional Â£120 million to local authorities.
The funding represents the equivalent of a 4% Council Tax rise.
Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said whilst councils have full flexibility in setting local council tax rates, there is no requirement for any inflation-busting increases in 2022-23.
The money is being made available after the UK Government advised that the Scottish Government should anticipate further funding for 2021-22, funding which will be confirmed at the Spring Supplementary Estimates next month.
Speaking during the Stage One Budget Bill debate, Ms Forbes said:
â€œI am in no doubt about the important role local authorities play in our communities and in helping manage our ongoing response to the pandemic. I also understand the financial challenges they face.
â€œThe 2022-23 Scottish Budget remains fully allocated and for weeks the UK Government has been telling us not to expect further funding. That has now suddenly changed and the UK Government has advised that we should anticipate further funding for 2021-22 which will be confirmed at the Spring Supplementary Estimates next month.
â€œConsequently I now have some new flexibility and am pleased to confirm my intention to utilise the Scotland Reserve to carry forward sufficient funding to allow me to allocate a further Â£120 million of resource to local government. Councils will have complete flexibility to allocate this additional funding as they wish in 2022-23.
â€œCouncils asked for an additional Â£100 million to deal with particular pressures. We have heard them and listened and we are going to go further. This will allow them to deal with the most pressing issues they face. At a time when people are understandably worried about the cost of living, I would point out this increase in funding would be equivalent to a 4% increase in Council Tax next year, so whilst councils have full flexibility in setting local council tax rates, I do not believe that there is a requirement for any inflation-busting increases next year.â€            ",1/27/2022,Funding boost for local councils

                        Finance Secretary urges MSPs to back spending plans.
                    

The 2022-23 Scottish Budget should be supported by MSPs to help accelerate economic recovery, tackle the climate emergency and reduce entrenched inequalities, according to Finance Secretary Kate Forbes.
It is the Scottish Governmentâ€™s first Budget in partnership with the Scottish Green Party.
Speaking ahead of the Stage One Budget Bill debate in Parliament, Ms Forbes said:
â€œOur bold and ambitious spending plans are focused on supporting our key priorities, ensuring no one and no region is left behind. It targets resources towards low income households, invests in initiatives to end Scotlandâ€™s contribution to climate change and fundamentally, provides much needed investment to bolster our economic recovery.
â€œRecognising the severe impacts of the pandemic, Â£18 billion will support health boards and accelerate the recovery of vital health and social care services. Significant funding is also being provided to support the next steps in the single greatest public health reform since the establishment of the NHS â€“ the creation of a new National Care Service.
â€œThis Budget also funds our key priority of tackling child poverty and inequality, by targeting over Â£4 billion in social security payments, including Â£197 million to double the game-changing Scottish Child Payment from April 2022.
â€œGreen recovery and economic transformation are central to our spending plans and an investment of at least Â£2 billion in infrastructure initiatives will support green jobs and accelerate efforts to become a net-zero economy, in addition to Â£150 million to create an active travel nation.
â€œDespite increased financial pressures, we are also continuing to treat councils fairly and we are providing a real terms increase of over 5% to local authority budgets for the coming year â€“ despite cuts to Scotlandâ€™s overall budget by the UK Government.
â€œIt cannot go unsaid that despite the ambition of this Budget, it comes amidst an extremely challenging fiscal backdrop and difficult decisions have had to be made. With uncertainty surrounding the cost of living, sky high energy prices, the ongoing impacts of the pandemic and the fallout from Brexit, I urge MSPs across the chamber to support this Budget and help us secure the way forward to becoming a fairer, greener, more prosperous country.â€Â Â

                        Joint call from the devolved governments.
                    

Finance Ministers in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have called on the Treasury to guarantee that money allocated to support Covid responses will be provided in full, following a meeting with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury.
They are also urging action to tackle the cost of living crisis and help households with rising bills.
Last month, as a result of spending in England, the Treasury announced it would provide additional funding to tackle Covid, with the Scottish Government allocated Â£440 million, the Welsh Government Â£270 million and the Northern Ireland Executive Â£150 million. The devolved governments are concerned they may not be granted permission to carry over into next yearâ€™s budgets any late consequential payments â€“ despite this flexibility being provided in 2021/22.
The Finance Ministers today also re-iterated a request for the Treasury to provide support to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland if the public health situation in each nation demands it, not just when the assistance is applied in England.
In addition, they are calling on the Treasury to help households facing a cost of living crisis. In October the UK Government withdrew the Â£20-a-week uplift to Universal Credit, a cut that was opposed by all three devolved nations. Last month it was confirmed that inflation had risen to 5.1% - the highest rate in a decade â€“ with increasingly expensive food, transport and clothing contributing to higher household bills. Powers to help households meet the cost of living lie mainly with the UK Government, and the three Finance Ministers want the Treasury to step up and deliver more support to households.
Scottish Government Finance and Economy Secretary Kate Forbes said: 
â€œI welcome todayâ€™s discussion and the constructive approach taken by all sides.
â€œHowever, along with the other devolved administrations, the Scottish Government remains concerned that the additional funding we have received to mitigate the impact of the Omicron variant may be subject to future deductions. Without the ability to borrow, this continuing uncertainty could have a substantial damaging impact on our COVID response and our ability to support public services in Scotland.
â€œMore fundamentally, the situation highlights once again that it is not tenable for funding only to be triggered by public health decisions in England. A system is required that supports the decisions of each devolved administration and is not beholden to the decisions of one part of the UK.
â€œThe Scottish Government has set out a range of ambitious actions - within our limited resources - to support households and reduce inequalities, including our commitment to double the game-changing Scottish Child Payment to Â£20 per child per week. But people are facing a cost of living crisis and the UK Government, which reduced the lifeline Universal Credit uplift in October despite our representations, must now urgently intervene.â€
Welsh Government Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said:
â€œWe need to see urgent action from the Treasury to help people with rising bills and living costs. Domestic energy prices are of particular concern at the moment with more and more people living in fuel poverty. This winter the Welsh Government invested Â£51m in our Household Support Fund to help households, but most of the powers and the fiscal resources needed to address the cost-of-living crisis are in the UK Governmentâ€™s hands. The Treasury must step up. Additional support through targeted UK-wide schemes such as the Warm Home Discount and other winter fuel payments would lessen the burden on hard pressed households.
â€œArrangements for Covid funding also need to change. Last month, as the omicron variant took hold, the Treasury hesitated before providing Wales with funding to meet the challenges. When funding did come, we received no guarantee that it would not need to be returned. The Treasury must recognise the importance of fully supporting devolved nations to help protect our businesses and protect our populations.â€
Conor Murphy, Minister of Finance, Northern Ireland Executive said:
â€œAs we continue to deal with the challenges posed by Omicron the uncertainty surrounding the Covid funding provided by Treasury is unhelpful. It is also hugely concerning that Treasury may not permit funding to be carried into next year even if additional funding is confirmed at such a late stage that it prevents it being used most effectively. We have been calling on Treasury to reinstate the Self Employed Income Support Scheme and furlough scheme on a targeted basis where necessary. It is disappointing that Treasury is unwilling to provide support to workers and their families. We would ask Treasury to urgently reconsider this position.
â€œThe cost of living crisis is causing hardship for families and businesses. Iâ€™ve been calling on Treasury to suspend VAT on energy bills temporarily to provide reprieve during the difficult winter period. It is time for Treasury to act now.â€            ",1/12/2022,Finance Ministers seek Covid funding flexibility

                        Extension of Practical Training Fund.
                    

More women and girls living and working in Scottish agriculture will be able to apply for funding for courses to help develop their skills. Eligible courses include support to get tractor and trailer driving certificates or help to train sheepdogs.
The Practical Training Fund, which was launched earlier this year and is administered by Lantra Scotland, has already supported more than 400 women and girls to undertake courses to develop their skillset or change careers.
From today, women and girls over the age of 13 can apply for up to Â£500, or more on a case by case basis, for the cost of a practical or technical training course through the fund, with the first batch of successful applicants being notified by the end of January 2022.
It has been supported by another Â£75,000 of Scottish Government funding, with Â£20,000 of the funding ring-fenced for applicants living in island communities.
Rural Affairs Secretary Mairi Gougeon said:
â€œThis year, we have committed Â£300,000 to support women in agriculture, including: the wider roll-out of the personal development training programme â€˜Be Your Best Selfâ€™; a project to test innovative solutions for childcare in rural areas and the development of Skillseeder â€“ a skills sharing app which provides an easy to use one-stop shop to find training and skills development opportunities across the country, particularly for those in rural and island areas.
â€œWe want to see more women joining those who are already developing a career in Scottish agriculture â€“ which is why itâ€™s important that women are given these opportunities in what has been a very male-dominated industry.
â€œThroughout this year, weâ€™ve heard from women and girls who have undertaken courses through the Practical Training Fund and said that they have more confidence and are more knowledgeable, which is great to hear. I would encourage more women to visit the Lantra Scotland website and apply.â€

                        Help for low income households this festive period.
                    


  Projects that support low income households will benefit from a funding boost through the Scottish Governmentâ€™s Winter Support Fund. 
  A total of 16 charities will receive a share of over Â£6 million to provide support to low income families with direct assistance for living costs, as well as initiatives such as debt advice and parenting helplines. 
  The cash is part of a Â£41 million Winter Support Fund announced by the Social Justice Secretary in October which also includes Â£10 million to help people struggling to pay fuel bills and Â£25 million awarded to local authorities to respond to financial insecurity and support wellbeing based on local needs. 
  The Winter Support Fund aims to help people on low incomes, children and people at risk of homelessness against a backdrop of rising living and fuel costs. 
  Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison said: 
  â€œWe know many families are struggling financially just now with the rising cost of living and the impact of the pandemic. 
  â€œThe recent sharp increase in Covid-19 cases, linked to the omicron variant, has only added to the challenge but weâ€™re determined to ease some of the strain by providing direct support to people who need it most. 
  â€œOur trusted charity partners and volunteers have played a crucial role throughout the pandemic and we appreciate and value the services they provide. 
  â€œWe hope these funds will help those most in need over Christmas, which we appreciate can be a difficult time for many.â€ 
  The STV Childrenâ€™s Appeal will receive Â£1,200,000 to support children in need through its network of grassroots and community organisations. 
  Chair Paul Reynolds said: 
  â€œThe winter period is often one of the most difficult times of the year for families affected by poverty in Scotland, so this support package comes at the most crucial of times.â€œThrough collaboration with hundreds of charities and projects, we support the most vulnerable children and young people across the country, and weâ€™ll help to make sure that these funds provide the food, clothing, shelter and heating needed by so many families throughout this challenging season.â€ 
  Aberlour Childrenâ€™s Charity will receive Â£250,000 for its Urgent Assistance Fund. 
  Chief Executive SallyAnn Kelly said: 
  â€œThis support comes at a time when families and their children are facing the second tough winter in a row. It will make a real difference to so many families, who have found themselves pushed into poverty and who are struggling to keep their head above water. 
  â€œApplications for our fund have doubled in recent months and the top reason for families seeking help is to feed their children. Itâ€™s vitally important that this funding is distributed to families quickly and reaches those children who need the very basics.â€

The introduction of Adult Disability Payment and extension of Scottish Child Payment to children under 16 will see a major increase in the number of people eligible to receive Sottish benefits in 2022.
The Scottish Child Payment will increase to Â£20 from April, giving increased support to 111,000 children under the age of six. Its extension to children under 16 by the end of 2022, subject to the DWP making data available, will see the number of eligible children more than double to 400,000.
Adult Disability Payment, the twelfth benefit and most complex to be introduced so far, will replace the UK Governmentâ€™s Personal Independence Payment. It will be phased in from March, with nationwide rollout at the end of August.
To support this, Social Security Scotland is in the process of recruiting up to 2,000 people by autumn 2022 with the first new recruits set to start early in the New Year - the biggest expansion since its formation in 2018, creating jobs and a boost to local economies.
Minister for Social Security Ben Macpherson said:
â€œ2022 will be our biggest year yet in building a new social security system for Scotland with the powers we have.
â€œThe major milestones of introducing Adult Disability Payment and extending Scottish Child Payment will be transformative for many people with a disability or health condition and for families on low incomes.
â€œBy the end of 2022 we aim to have extended the Scottish Child Payment to all those under the age of 16 - subject to the DWP making data available - increasing eligibility to around 400,000 children.
â€œFrom April the doubling of our Scottish Child Payment will significantly help us to reduce child poverty and build a fairer society.
â€œThe Â£20 payment per child per week will be four times what was originally asked for by anti-poverty campaigners and we hope to lift 40,000 Scottish children out of poverty in 2023/24.
â€œApplying for Adult Disability Payment from Social Security Scotland will be different to applying to the DWP, as we will deliver a much improved experience.
â€œThere will be no private sector involvement, we have removed DWP-style assessments and any consultations that are necessary will be person centred and wonâ€™t include functional examinations. Weâ€™ll start from a position of trust. Also, we are offering a range of ways to make an application, including online, by post, over the phone or face-to-face; and,Â in contrast to the current DWP system, weâ€™re removing the burden from individuals to provide supporting information - instead the onus will be on Social Security Scotland to collect the information we require. Weâ€™ll also fast-track clients who are facing a terminal illness and we will follow the judgement of clinicians instead of being tied to fixed periods of life expectancy.
â€œAs well as the positive impact of paying benefits, Social Security Scotland is also growing as an employer. This rapid development is not only making a difference in our communities but is also creating long-term secure employment across the country, and a Â£280 million contribution to our wider economy - something we can all welcome.
â€œScotlandâ€™s social security system is built on the values of dignity, fairness and respect, and these are the principles which will always guide us as we develop this important public service.â€
Citizens Advice Scotland Chief Executive Derek Mitchell said:
â€œCitizens Advice Scotland supported the introduction and then doubling of the Scottish Child Payment because we know the difference it can make to families across the country. Weâ€™d encourage everyone eligible for the payment to apply and claim, thatâ€™s how our welfare state works â€“ we all pay in and get the support we are entitled to when we need it.Â 
â€œWith the cost of living starting to really bite people can get help and advice from the Citizens Advice network to see what support they are entitled to. Weâ€™ve been helping people for over 80 years and unlocked Â£147 million for people last year.â€
Background:
Scottish Child Payment, which is unique in the UK, will be fully rolled out to children under the age of 16 by the end of 2022, subject to data on qualifying benefits being received from the Department of Work and Pensions.
Social Security Scotland was established in September 2018 and delivers 11 benefits â€“ including seven which are brand new.
The introduction of Adult Disability Payment, in Spring 2022, will increase the number of benefits to 12 as Social Security Scotland starts to deliver more complex disability payments.Â 
The organisation will ultimately make payments to 1.8 million people â€“ around one in three people in Scotland
Phase One of the Adult Disability pilot takes place in Perthshire and Kinross, City of Dundee and Western Isles on 21 March 2022 and be phased in over the summer with the rollout nationwide from 29 August 2021
People who currently get disability benefits from Department for Work and Pensions will have their awards transferred to the new Scottish system in stages after the new benefits are introduced from summer 2022.

The 2022-2023 Scottish Budget will help transition Scotland to becoming more prosperous, fairer and greener, Finance Secretary Kate Forbes has said.
Speaking ahead of delivering the Budget to Parliament today, Ms Forbes said the Scottish Government will deliver a bold and ambitious package of public investment that delivers on the priorities which matter most to the people of Scotland. Â 
Ms Forbes said:
â€œThe Scottish Budget will provide taxpayers with stability and support, set out clearly how we will accelerate our Covid recovery, and crucially, how our spending plans will set Scotland on a new ambitious path.
â€œIt has been a challenging Budget due to the continuing impact of the pandemic, and the uncertainty and worry that Covid poses for us all. This has been confounded by the UK Governmentâ€™s decision to remove necessary Covid consequential funding at a time when we undeniably need to help our public services.
â€œThe Scottish Government has taken spending decisions that prioritise supporting people and our vital public services through the twin crises of Covid and the cost of living. It is a budget for Scotlandâ€™s future â€“ one that will help us secure a fairer, greener and more prosperous country.â€

                        Plans will support families through the cost of living crisis.
                    

Initiatives to tackle the climate emergency, support economic recovery and reduce inequalities will be at the heart of this yearâ€™s Scottish Budget.
The 2022-23 Budget, which will be presented to the Scottish Parliament on 9 December, will set out how the Scottish Government will forge a path that transitions Scotland towards becoming a fairer, more prosperous and greener country.
Speaking ahead of the Scottish Budget, Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said it comes against a challenging fiscal backdrop and the impacts of the ongoing Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
Ms Forbes said:
â€œThis is a critical time for Scotland - we are still in the grip of the pandemic and families and businesses across the country are bearing the brunt of the cost of living crisis. However, in these times of crisis, we need to go beyond the norm.
â€œWhile the pandemic may have defined our lives in recent times, the Scottish Government is determined it does not define our future. The 2022-2023 Scottish Budget that I will present on Thursday is another stepping stone towards a fairer, greener, more prosperous future.
â€œThis Budget will provide certainty and stability for families whilst working to reduce inequalities, the process for which has already begun with the First Minister recently announcing the doubling of the Child Payment to Â£20 per child per week from April next year, reaching over 105,000 children under age 6 in just four monthsâ€™ time.Â  When we extend the Scottish Child Payment to all under 16s at the end of next year, over 400,000 children and their families will be eligible.
â€œWe will also invest in infrastructure that allows us to drive down emissions and create the green jobs of the future that come with the transition to a greener Scotland and set out plans to bolster our economic recovery and support our public services.
â€œThis yearâ€™s Budget is set against a challenging fiscal backdrop as a result of the UK Governmentâ€™s decision to reduce Scotlandâ€™s day-to-day spending by removing ongoing COVID funding, despite the continuing impacts of the pandemic. The Budget I will present on Thursday will enable the Scottish Government to make good on our promise to build a fairer, greener Scotland. That is our social, economic and environmental imperative.â€            ",12/5/2021,"Ambitious Budget for a fairer, more prosperous Scotland"

                        More than Â£1 million of funding allocated.
                    


  Innovative projects to reopen some of the libraries that closed during the pandemic, set up wellbeing cafes or provide home library services have received more than Â£1 million in funding. 
  The Scottish Governmentâ€™s Â£1.25 million Public Library COVID Relief Fund will support 23 projects around the country to re-connect communities with their libraries. 
  Applications were made through the Scottish Library and Information Council (SLIC) and allocations will also support reading and STEM education programmes. 
  While priority was given to applications which support deprived areas and communities, all library services across Scotland were invited to apply for the fund. 
  Culture Minister Jenny Gilruth said: 
  â€œThese funding allocations will support public libraries across Scotland. Libraries that closed because of the pandemic will re-open and others will be able to widen the services that they offer their local communities. 
  â€œLibraries are so much more than a place to borrow books. This fund will see the provision of community-centred projects aimed at, among other things, reducing social isolation, promoting mental wellbeing and reducing the poverty-related attainment gap. 
  â€œThis funding is part of the Governmentâ€™s wider aspiration to drive a cultural recovery for our communities. I look forward to seeing how libraries use this support to benefit their local area and to working with the library sector on our future recovery plansâ€. 
  Scottish Library and Information Council Chair Ian Ruthven said: 
  â€œPublic libraries are an essential part of Scotland's social fabric, supporting and inspiring people to fulfil their potential for over 150 years. 
  â€œImproving mental wellbeing, tackling social isolation and closing the digital divide are some of the key aims of public libraries. The Public Library COVID Relief Fund will allow local public libraries to reconnect with their communities and offer these much-valued services.â€

                        Finance Secretary writes to the Chancellor.
                    

Finance Secretary Kate Forbes has written to Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak calling for additional spending to support households and businesses who are facing a perfect storm of rising prices, reduced support and increasing shortages.
Writing ahead of the UK Autumn Budget and Comprehensive Spending Review, Ms Forbes urged the Chancellor to at least match the Scottish Governmentâ€™s Â£500 million Just Transition Fund for the North East and Moray and increase the Scottish Governmentâ€™s borrowing powers to enable greater investment in decarbonisation schemes.
She also called for an extension of the reduced 12.5% VAT rate for the hospitality sector, which is due to end on 31 March 2022, for a further year, Â a reversal of the decision not to award the Scottish carbon capture, utilisation and storage project Track-1 status and for the UK Government to â€œprioritise spending that supports the financial security of low-incomeÂ households, the wellbeing of children and young people and delivers good, green jobs and fair work.â€Â 
The letter states:
Dear Rishi,
I am writing to you in advance of the UK Government announcing the Autumn Budget and Comprehensive Spending Review on 27 October, with a view to constructively progressing the recent dialogue with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and the First Ministerâ€™s meeting with the Prime Minister.
I am conscious that over recent days there has been wide media coverage in relation to Budget and Spending Review content. The reports have contained differing degrees of detail and a lack of clarity on how much of the predicted spend is new. In the absence of direct engagement, I have not reflected this information.
The Scottish Government will work to ensure that our responses to the unprecedented public health, economic and wider challenges presented by Covid deliver for the benefit of all of Scotland. This environment is compounded by the complexity and financial detriment to Scotland of the UK Governmentâ€™s decision to leave the European Union against the will of the Scottish people, while we continue to work urgently to address the needs of climate change. These challenges will require short and long-term solutions and I set out below how the UK Budget and Spending Review can support priorities in Scotland.
Net ZeroCOP 26 in Glasgow will focus international attention on the urgent action needed to tackle the global climate emergency. As outlined in the joint nations letter, and by the UK Climate Change Committee, significant investment is required from the UK Government in reserved areas to meet the Scottish Governmentâ€™s ambitious emissions reduction targets. Given the requirement for co-ordinated action to address this challenge, it was disappointing that the UK Net Zero Strategy was launched without any meaningful engagement. The UK Net Zero Strategy provides some encouragement in key areas, but overall does not go far enough in many of the critical elements for ensuring the deep decarbonisation that the Scottish Government has repeatedly called for action in.
In Scotland, our climate change targets set their own pace and scale, requiring us to avail ourselves of every lever at our disposal. However, many levers remain at UK level, even where they affect Scotland directly. Following on from our recent meetings, it is worth highlighting again those actions which would most benefit our delivery in relation to funding key climate change commitments:
Removal of the capital borrowing cap, replacing this with a prudential borrowing scheme to help leverage the greater volume of capital investment required;
Agreement that all new spending will reflect the devolution settlement, enabling us to address Scotlandâ€™s specific challenges in making the transition to net zero (such as the needs of rural populations);
Meaningful and consistent dialogue between UK Government and Devolved Governments to allow consideration of all relevant input in advance of key green policy and regulatory decisions;
Engagement in relation to the net zero roadmap and other key strategies.
The Scottish Government has committed to working with partners, communities and other stakeholders to take forward a ten-year Â£500m Just Transition Fund for the North East and Moray. Given the UK Treasury has, over decades, benefited from billions of pounds of revenue from activity in the North Sea, I ask that you at least match our commitment to help secure jobs the North East of Scotland, support the energy transition, and reduce emissions.
There are a number of areas where we need the UK Government to take more action and act faster, including support for carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS). Scotland represents the most cost-effective and deliverable opportunity for CCS in the UK by the mid-2020s. Therefore, the recent UK Government announcement failing to award the Scottish Cluster clear and definitive Track-1 project status as part of your CCUS cluster sequencing process is illogical. We have previously advised the UK Government that we would help to support the Scottish Cluster, and stand ready to do so. However, we do not hold all the necessary legislative and regulatory levers which are retained by the UK Government. We are therefore calling upon the UK Government to reverse this decision, and accelerate the Scottish Cluster to full Track-1 status without delay.
Health & Social CareI welcome the approach from UK Government officials to Scottish Government equivalents to form a working group in relation to the implementation of the levy, however this rise will have a notable impact on taxpayers in Scotland. Without necessary investments in supporting low-income households, this regressive approach to revenue generation will further compound the financial hardship many families already face as detailed above.
Whilst the UK Government has provided indications of the consequentials we will receive as a result of this tax rise, I remain concerned that reductions will be made in other areas giving rise to negative consequentials overall, and ask that this is ruled out in the forthcoming Budget and spending review. As part of this, I expect the allocation to devolved administrations will cover the full costs of the levy that will be incurred by our public sector employers including local government.
It is imperative that the UK budget delivers on your commitment to ensure that the NHS receives whatever support it needs throughout this pandemic. While the Health and Social Care Levy will go some way to supporting services, it is clear in particular that this will be insufficient to address the scale of social care pressure and consequent impact on NHS services.
I reiterate my previous call for a comprehensive package of investment, taking the whole health and social care system into account, both in terms of delivery of services and addressing specific Covid-19 pressures. I would also reaffirm the need for increased transparency of UK Government spending arrangements, so that the Scottish Government is clear on the funding that will arise from key programmes such as testing and vaccinations. As I have previously highlighted, it will continue to be necessary for the UK Government to accommodate flexibility across the UK in these programmes of activity, so that devolved administrations can deploy resources in a manner that best meets spending profiles and specific needs in Scotland.
Recovery from the Combined Impacts of Covid and EU Exit
The Barnett guarantee provided in 2020-21 was a successful demonstration of the benefits of fiscal flexibility. UK fiscal policy and any new fiscal rules should be flexible as well as credible. This is something the Institute for Fiscal Studies has recently advocated to ensure fiscal policy can continue to respond to temporary economic shocks and help ensure fairness across generations. It is essential that the UK Government adopt such an approach.
As I have previously communicated, the Scottish Government is strongly opposed to any return to austerity and strongly urge you to reinstate the Â£20-per week uplift to Universal Credit. A real cost-of-living crisis is emerging as a result of this cut, combined with the escalating energy costs and upcoming rise in National Insurance Contributions. The Universal Credit cut alone will push an extra 60,000 people in Scotland, including 20,000 children, into poverty and hundreds of thousands more into hardship, whilst also reducing social security expenditure in Scotland by Â£461m by 2023-24.
I cannot accept that these cuts to individual income, alongside other poverty-inducing policies such as the benefit cap, or the two child limit for child tax credit are justifiable at this time. The UK Budget must prioritise spending that supports the financial security of low-income households, the wellbeing of children and young people, and delivers good, green jobs and fair work.
The choices made by the UK Government following Brexit are contributing to labour and skills shortages in Scotland. As predicted by Scottish Government modelling, severe impacts are disproportionately concentrated on the food and drink sector, particularly seafood, meat and dairy, as well as beverages and textiles. Evidence is mounting, including from BICs and HMRC Regional Trade Statistics to illustrate the detrimental impact on our trading performance, and supporting my call for the UK Government to re-engage in good faith with the EU and find pragmatic solutions to the blockages confronting businesses. Where these create additional new costs or obstacles, I ask that the UK Budget and Spending Review is transparent about the impact and provides additional financial support to help compensate businesses for the losses incurred as a direct result of EU Exit.
Public Sector PayDecisions on public sector pay by the UK Government in this Budget and Spending Review are a material factor in setting pay awards for the public sector workforce in Scotland. Any continuation of the UK Government pay freeze has a material impact on our block grant settlement, within which we must balance reward and affordability. Public sector pay awards must be progressive, fair and allow valued workers to maintain their standard of living, as they continue to deliver the strong and innovative public services our people deserve.
Capital InvestmentThere is much common ground between UK and Scottish Government infrastructure priorities in delivering our net zero targets, delivering new jobs and securing Covid recovery. However, our economic recovery could be damaged if this spend is not prioritised and committed within the UK Budget. The decision taken by the UK Government to disburse the Levelling-Up Fund directly across the UK, despite previous commitments otherwise, impacts on the level of devolved funding available to the Scottish Government for Scotland. To help achieve our Net Zero aims and grow our economy, I would welcome your assurance that the Scottish Government will receive a fair share of future yearsâ€™ Capital and Financial Transactions allocations; that the gap in the Scottish Budget resulting from the change in approach to the Levelling Up Fund will be filled and that there will be appropriate governance arrangements for the UK Infrastructure Bank and other partnerships or funding routes to ensure that all interested parties have an appropriate ability to influence and control spend in the relevant areas of the UK.
VATI believe that the UK Government must make responsible tax policy decisions that will support the sectors and businesses economy throughout this challenging period, and I welcome measures taken on VAT to date. However, I am convinced that the increase in VAT from 1 October comes too soon. This will affect many businesses that have been hit hardest by the Covid pandemic, potentially leading to their closure and therefore slowing the economic recovery in Scotland. It is vital that the UK Government takes account of the needs of all parts of the UK when deciding how best to support the recovery through its taxation levers, and I urge you to consider extending the reduced rate of VAT for the next financial year.
Air Passenger DutyAs you will be aware, the Scottish Government has a strong interest in the UK Governmentâ€™s consideration of next steps for Air Passenger Duty following this yearâ€™s consultation on aviation tax reform. We accordingly asked to be fully consulted on any decisions before they are made, to ensure that any implications for devolution and the interests of Scotland are taken fully into account. In that regard, it is concerning to see that the media appears to have been briefed on those decisions, without any discussion with the Scottish Government having occurred. Moving forwards, I would welcome your full commitment to meaningful dialogue on this, and indeed on all relevant tax matters, in advance of media briefings.
Replacement of EU FundingIn common with my counterparts in the Devolved Administrations, I expect full replacement of EU funds to ensure no detriment to Scotlandâ€™s finances, and I expect the UK Government to fully respect the devolution settlement in any future arrangements.
The current approach to the replacement of and participation in EU programmes leaves Scotland worse off. The ability to undertake long-term strategic planning has been significantly undermined as the flexible seven-year multi-annual funding mechanisms of EU funding are being replaced by annually managed allocations. Furthermore, the proposed methodology for determining farm funding allocations effectively penalises the use of the remaining flexibilities from legacy funding. I have written to you jointly with other finance ministers from the Devolved Administrations in order to express our concerns about this methodology and our expectations regarding future allocations.
With regards to fisheries, I consider the existing settlement to be vastly insufficient, given past underfunding and the significant impacts of Brexit on the sector. We provided clear evidence for a multi-year Â£62m allocation for Scottish fisheries, as opposed Â£14m allocation we received in the 20/21 Spending Review. Additionally, it appears that the yearly Â£5.5m top up which was previously provided to Scotland on the basis that the EU EMFF allocation was insufficient will no longer continue, increasing an already significant funding shortfall.
This process seems to mirror our experience with the Bew review, where commitments made in 20/21 are then being downgraded within the life of this parliament. In the case of the Bew review, this was to agree a process of engagement ahead of the upcoming Spending Review to address the issue of Bew funding from 2022/23 onwards. While the initial recommendations of the Bew review have been met, the proposed funding does not include any additional budget cover beyond 2021-22. This leaves Scotland in the same position as in 2019 where the inequality in distribution of land remains an issue. Further discussions need to take place on the principle of intra-UK allocations in line with the wider observations of the Bew review. In the absence of such a review we would expect at least the Â£25.7m funding to continue beyond 2021-22 to address the funding inequality included in the previous ceiling levels. A failure to do so would result in a cut of Â£77.1m in our budget up to 2025. I require assurance that the UK Budget and Spending Review will redress these issues to ensure no detriment to Scotlandâ€™s finances.
Internal Market ActThe financial assistance powers in the Internal Market Act (IMA) confer new powers on UK ministers to spend directly in a wide range of devolved matters, bypassing parliamentary scrutiny and accountability at Holyrood. This also, in effect, gives the UK Government the power to bypass the Barnett Formula. Aside from being a profound departure from the existing devolution settlement, it introduces considerable additional uncertainty to future devolved funding and fundamentally alters the devolution landscape.
I ask for assurance that the powers will not be used without the prior consent of the Devolved Governments, and for clarity on how decisions on use of IMA financial assistance powers will be made, and under what circumstances. Without this it is difficult to see how the principles of consent, transparency, and stability and predictability espoused in the Statement of Funding Policy can be met. Moreover, it risks poor value for money as a result of incoherent policy and disjointed spending decisions.
As a minimum I would ask that the forthcoming spending review set out details on any plans to spend under the IMA over the course of the period (and beyond where known), and that the implications for devolved funding arrangements and decision-making are addressed in the planned update to the Statement of Funding Policy.
I trust that you will consider the suggestions made above and that we can work collaboratively to address the matters raised in order to provide certainty to the wider public sector, boost the economy and support our most vulnerable at this challenging time.

                        Consultation on new approach to prevent food insecurity.
                    

Proposals to end the need for food banks as a primary response to food insecurity have been published.
Views are being sought on the Scottish Governmentâ€™s draft national plan, which is supported by food bank operators, including the Trussell Trust and Independent Food Aid Network.
The plan follows action during the pandemic to prevent food insecurity through strengthening household incomes and the delivery of cash-first responses to financial hardship.
Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison said:
â€œWe share the same vision as food bank operators â€“ they are not a long term solution to poverty. Our draft plan sets out what we will do within our powers â€“ including introducing a shopping voucher pilot scheme - to make food banks the last port of call. Â 
â€œOver the last year we have invested around Â£2.5 billion to support low income households, including nearly Â£1 billion to directly support children.
â€œDespite our fixed budget and limited powers we are taking action to support those in poverty, including discussions around establishing a minimum income guarantee for Scotland.
â€œAs part of the right to an adequate standard of living, people need to be able to access food that meets their dietary, social and cultural needs and this plan shows the way forward.â€
Sabine Goodwin, co-ordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network, which represents more than 500 food banks across the UK, said: ""As the cut to Universal Credit and cost of living increases exacerbate poverty in Scotland, the publication of the draft national plan to end the need for food banks couldn't be more timely.
â€œWith a cash first, collaborative approach to food insecurity as the cornerstone of this plan, a time when food banks will no longer be needed to plug the gaps left by financial hardshipÂ is within sight.""
Background
Ending the Need for Food Banks consultation 
The draft national plan aligns with the Scottish Governmentâ€™s national mission to eradicate poverty, the Tackling Child Poverty Delivery Plan and Good Food Nation ambition.
The Statement on Food Insecurity and Poverty published in February, details the Scottish Governmentâ€™s approach to human rights, prioritising action that prevents poverty and promoting cash-first responses alongside holistic support services where needed.

                        Record winter funding package to help increase NHS and social care capacity this winter.
                    

A substantial new investment of over Â£300 million in hospital and community care has been unveiled to help tackle what is anticipated to be the toughest winter the NHS and social care system has ever faced.
The new multi-year funding will support a range of measures to maximise capacity in our hospitals and primary care, reduce delayed discharges, improve pay for social care staff, and ensure those in the community who need support receive effective and responsive care.
The NHS and Care Winter Package of additional funding includes:
Recruiting 1,000 additional NHS staff to support multi-disciplinary working
Â£40 million for â€˜step-downâ€™ care to enable hospital patients to temporarily enter care homes, or receive additional care at home support, with no financial liability to the individual or their family towards the cost of the care home
Over Â£60 million to maximise the capacity of care at home services
Up to Â£48 million will be made available to increase the hourly rate of social care staff to match new NHS band 2 staff
Â£20 million to enhance Multi-Disciplinary Teams, enable more social work assessments to be carried out and support joint working between health and social care
Â£28 million of additional funding to support primary care
Â£4.5 million available to Health Boards to attract at least 200 registered nurses from outwith Scotland by March 2022
Â£4 million to help staff with their practical and emotional needs, including pastoral care and other measures to aid rest and recuperation
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said:
â€œAs the winter period approaches, it is vital that we do all we can to maximise the capacity of the NHS and social care system. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m setting out our Â£300 million NHS and Care Winter Package today. We cannot look at the NHS in isolation we must take a whole systems approach and these measures will help alleviate pressure across the NHS and social care.
â€œThis significant new investment will help get people the care they need as quickly as possible this winter. Bolstering the caring workforce by increasing their numbers, providing them with additional support, and increasing the wages of social care staff.
â€œWeâ€™ve previously provided funding to ensure that adult social care staff are paid at least the real living wage. Today weâ€™re going further and our new investment will ensure that adult social care staff who are currently paid the real living wage will get a pay rise of over 5%
â€œMeasures I have announced today will help patients whose discharge has been delayed waiting for care and help get them out of hospital and on to the next stage in their care. This helps the individual by getting them the right care, and helps the wider system by ensuring the hospital capacity is being used by those who need that specialist level of clinical care.
â€œThis Â£300 million of new funding will also fund increases in social care capacity in the community and in primary care - helping to ease the pressure on unpaid carers.
â€œOur NHS, social care staff and social work staff have been remarkable throughout the pandemic and todayâ€™s additional investment will help support them to deliver care to people across Scotland this winter.â€

                        Calls to keep â€˜lifelineâ€™ Â£20-a-week uplift.
                    

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has joined with the First Minister of Wales and the First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland to demand Prime Minister Boris Johnson â€œdo the right thingâ€ by reversing the decision to withdraw the Â£20-a-week uplift to Universal Credit.
In a rare joint intervention, the leaders of the devolved nations have warned in a letter that the UK Government â€œis withdrawing this lifeline just as the country is facing a significant cost-of-living crisis.â€
They have urged the Prime Minister to â€œconsider the moral, social and economic harmsâ€ of the of this cut, and â€œdo the right thingâ€ and reverse his governmentâ€™s decision to withdraw this funding which will harm around 6 million people across the UK.
The First Minister, along with Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford and Northern Ireland First Minister and deputy First Minister Paul Givan and Michelle Oâ€™Neill say the move, which comes into effect this Wednesday, 6 October, is short sighted at a time of increases in the cost of food and fuel, rising inflation, the end of the furlough scheme, and imminent rise in National Insurance contributions.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:
â€œI do not think there has been anything quite so morally indefensible in UK policy in recent times as the proposed cut to Universal Credit.
â€œAt a time when we are facing the impact of the pandemic, Brexit and soaring costs, removing Â£20 per week from the lowest-income households simply cannot be defended in any way, shape or form.
â€œThe planned cut represents the biggest overnight reduction to the basic rate of social security in more than 70 years and would sever a crucial lifeline for countless households across the UK at a time when budgets are already facing an unprecedented squeeze.
â€œIt is an immoral, ill-thought out and ultimately counterproductive policy which simply must be stopped. Â 
â€œThose on low incomes are going to find it difficult to feed their children, heat their homes, and pay their rent if the cut goes ahead. We have therefore united as the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to say to the Prime Minister: â€˜Do not do this.â€™â€
The full text of the letter is included below:
Dear Prime Minister
We are writing to call on you, with the utmost urgency, to reverse your Governmentâ€™s short-sighted decision to withdraw the Â£20-per-week uplift to Universal Credit.
Your Government is withdrawing this lifeline just as the country is facing a significant cost-of-living crisis. This winter millions of people are facing an untenable combination of increases to the cost of food and energy, rising inflation, the end of the furlough scheme, and an imminent hike to National Insurance contributions.
There is no rationale for cutting such crucial support at a point when people across the UK are facing an unprecedented squeeze on their household budgets.
Within the last month, an overwhelming majority of elected members in Holyrood, the Senedd, Stormont and Westminster have voiced their opposition to this cut to Universal Credit, as have the four social security committees of each parliament. The four Childrenâ€™s Commissioners of each nation, numerous charities and faith groups have also expressed their grave concerns as have millions of people who face additional and unnecessary hardship because of this cut to Universal Credit against the backdrop of a winter of hardship.
We note your Governmentâ€™s announcement of a Household Support Fund â€“ an acknowledgment that too many people will be unable to make ends meet this winter. Unfortunately, a Â£500 million fund handed out on a discretionary basis is wholly inadequate to making up the Â£6 billion shortfall in social security expenditure that will result from the cut to Universal Credit.
Your Government has repeatedly refused to conduct any impact analysis on the biggest overnight reduction to the basic rate of social security for more than 70 years.
As such, it is important that we draw your attention to the growing body of evidence and analysis about the harm this cut will inflict. Research by the Resolution Foundation and the Trussell Trust has highlighted the significant and devastating impact the cliff-edge withdrawal of the Â£20-a-week uplift to Universal Credit will have on family incomes, with an associated rise in food insecurity. The Legatum Institute has produced sobering analysis highlighting that the Â£20-per-week uplift has kept 840,000 people, including 290,000 children, out of poverty in Q2 of 2021. It makes no sense at all to knowingly pursue a policy that will result in this immense and needless rise in child poverty and we ask you to consider the lasting harm and costs of this cut accordingly.
It is important to note that this will increase poverty and hardship without delivering any tangible social or economic benefits. The UN Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights said â€“ when calling upon you to reverse this cut â€“ that for a healthy and well-qualified workforce to emerge, your Government must provide adequate levels of social protection. Years of a freeze on benefits means Universal Credit has not kept pace with rising living costs. Further to this, rising inflation means that a basic rate of Universal Credit after this cut will hold less purchasing power than it did in March 2020.
To support a meaningful recovery from this pandemic we must first ensure the needs of our most vulnerable are met. This cut threatens to undermine the recovery by diminishing the capacity of six million people to make ends meet.
It is not too late for you to reverse the decision to take money out of the pockets of the poorest in society at a time when they are facing a serious cost of living crisis.
We, with the full support of the Northern Ireland Executive and the Scottish and Welsh Governments, urge you to consider the moral, social and economic harms of this cut, and do the right thing and reverse your decision to withdraw this lifeline.
A copy of this letter is being sent to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and relevant Secretary of States for the devolved nations.
Yours sincerely

                        Â£2.6 million further funding.
                    

Further funding has been announced to provide short-term care for acutely unwell patients in their own homes.
An additional Â£2.6 million has been shared between ten health boards so they can continue to develop Hospital at Home services to avoid admissions to hospital.
Evidence shows this particularly benefits frail and elderly patients, since hospital admissions are associated with higher rates of delirium and increased chances of admission directly to care homes. A patientâ€™s ability to function can also deteriorate while they are in hospital, meaning they have higher needs for community care when they are discharged, and are also more likely to experience a delay in their discharge from hospital.
Being cared for by Hospital at Home increases the likelihood a patient can continue living at home six months after a period of acute illness, without being admitted to a care home.
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said:
â€œWe know hospitals are often not the best places for frail older people. Hospital at Home provides a safe and cost-effective alternative which focuses on the individual patientâ€™s needs.
â€œAcross Scotland 19 Health and Social Care Partnerships within ten health boards are currently developing a Hospital at Home service. This funding brings the total invested in Hospital at Home to just under Â£4 million.
â€œWe know older people are increasing in numbers and occupy a large proportion of hospital beds when they become frail. If some of these admissions can be avoided, with improved outcomes for patients, everyone benefits.â€

                        Funding for aid in Malawi, Rwanda and Zambia.
                    

A grant of more than Â£270,000 from the Scottish Governmentâ€™s International Development Fund will fund the supply of 300 items of vital equipment to treat Covid-19 patients in Africa.
The funding will allow Kids Operating Room, a Scottish-based global health charity, to distribute 100 oxygen concentrators each to Malawi, Rwanda, and Zambia.
Covid-19 cases in Malawi, Rwanda and Zambia are rising quickly, with the health system in Zambia especially under severe stress.
One of the biggest impacts of the rise in Covid-19 cases is a shortage of oxygen, and oxygen concentrators are easy to use, are suitable for patients of all ages, and can be used throughout the health service.
External Affairs Secretary Angus Robertson said:
â€œThe Covid situation in Malawi, Rwanda and Zambia has become very serious, very quickly, and we know that the pressure on health services are putting great stress on their infrastructure, especially in relation to the delivery of oxygen to patients.
â€œThis funding for oxygen concentrators will go some way to help ease the current stress on the health services in our three African partner countries, and we are delighted to work with Kids Operating Room to make sure this vital equipment is put to use as soon as possible.
â€œScotland remains fully committed to playing our part in tackling shared global challenges, and we are committed to increase the International Development Fund (IDF) by 50% to Â£15 million.
â€œAs the global pandemic continues, we firmly believe this is not the time to turn our back on the poorest and those in dire need â€“ instead, this is precisely the moment when we should be living up to our core values.â€
David Cunningham, the chief executive officer of Kids Operating Room, said: â€œOur model is to listen to doctors, then give them what they need - right now, the message is coming back loud and clear that what they need is access to more oxygen to fight Covid-19.
â€œOxygen concentrators are key pieces of equipment that are needed to meet the regionâ€™s critical oxygen shortage. They are suitable for all ages and durable for years to come post-Covid, making them incredibly essential to support the health services in the long-term.""
Background
Kids Operating Room is a Scottish global health charity with bases in Edinburgh, Dundee and Nairobi. It works directly with local surgeons and their teams across Africa and South America to transform hospital spaces into dedicated operating rooms for childrenâ€™s surgery.
Oxygen concentrators provide a sustainable and cost-effective source of medical oxygen â€“ they draw air from the environment and then concentrate that room oxygen to therapeutic levels for delivery to patients.
The charity will coordinate the distribution of the oxygen equipment.Â  They will arrange for delivery to doctors in Lusaka, Lilongwe and Kigali, and have the equipment distributed to the most in-demand hospitals.            ",7/17/2021,Vital equipment to fight Covid-19 crisis in Africa

                        Support scheme to be introduced this year.
                    

Hundreds of paramedic students in Scotland will receive an annual bursary ofÂ  Â£10,000 as part of a new scheme unveiled today.
An estimated 668 students will be eligible for the Paramedic, Nursing and Midwifery Student Bursary (PNMSB) for courses starting this September. The number of eligible students is expected to rise to almost 900 next year.Â 
Scottish-domiciled paramedic students who have already applied for undergraduate student fundingÂ  do not need to re-apply. The Student Awards Agency Scotland (SAAS) will automatically reassign students to the new funding package.
The new award, which will be paidÂ  over 12 months each academic year, was unveiled by Health Secretary Humza Yousaf during a visit to an ambulance station in Dundee where the minister metÂ  paramedic students.
Mr Yousaf said: ""The introduction of this bursary for our paramedic students fulfils this Government's pledge to bolster support for this crucial service.
""Paramedics have been a driving force in maintaining NHS services throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and I am determined to ensure we attract and support the next generation of these vital workers.
""Scottish student paramedics, studying in Scotland, will be able to apply for a bursary ofÂ  Â£10,000 a year, compared with the Â£5,000 bursary announced last year by the UK Government in England. These Scottish paramedic students can also apply for other associated additional allowances.
â€œScottish paramedic students studying in the rest of the UK will continue to receive the current undergraduate funding package of tuition fee loan, income-assessed living cost loans and bursary, as well as other additional grants they may be entitled to.
""Our allied health professionals are the third largest part of our NHS workforce and this announcement underlines our determination to remobilise the service as we emerge safely from the pandemic lockdown.""
Pauline Howie, Chief Executive of the Scottish Ambulance Service, said: â€œThis is fantastic news for current and prospective students across the country. They are an important part of our workforce and this announcement will be a real boost which will help encourage the paramedics of the future.Â 
""Our staff do an amazing job each day and this additional financial support is welcome.
â€œStudent paramedics have been in paid employment in a variety of roles during the pandemic and we are continuing to recruit additional staff across a variety of roles to help further improve services for patients.â€
BACKGROUND
The scheme is open to Scottish-domiciled paramedic science students at universities in Scotland.Â 
Paramedic students who have not applied for funding ahead of the 2021/22 academic year should apply for the new Paramedic, Nursing and Midwifery Student Bursary (PNMSB). Those who have already applied will have awards automatically updated to take account of the new bursary and do not need to contact the Student Awards Agency Scotland.Â Â

                        More than Â£14 million awarded to low income households.
                    

A total of 144,128 COVID Winter Hardship Payments have been made to families.
The payments are available to families with children receiving Free School Meals on the basis of low income, with Â£14.41 million given to households as part of the Scottish Governmentâ€™s Winter Plan for Social Protection.
A one-off payment of Â£100 was made, by local authorities, for each eligible child in receipt of Free School Meals between 30 November and the start of the winter holidays.
Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell said:
â€œWe know that many families are struggling financially due to the pandemic, whether through lost earnings, increased food costs or simply needing to run their heating more. This additional payment will hopefully have helped ease the strain they are facing.
â€œWe have now provided over Â£50 million in additional funding to local authorities to continue the provision of Free School Meals during school closures, periods of online learning and holidays from the summer, and we are committed to do so through the forthcoming Easter holidays.
â€œThe provision of Free School Meals outside of term time and the Â£100 payment are just two of the ways weâ€™re working to support people and communities. We have invested over Â£500 million to mitigate the negative impacts of the pandemic, which includes a Â£22 million increase to our Scottish Welfare Fund and considerable investment in support provided by community and third sector organisations.
â€œWith our Scottish Child Payment also due to start next week, we are showing our commitment to tackling poverty and inequality through this pandemic and beyond.â€
Background
The Â£100 million Winter Plan for Social Protection was developed to mitigate social harms posed by the concurrent risks of COVID-19, winter cost of living increases and EU exit, as well as to promote equality and human rights.
Families are eligible for their children to receive Free School Meals, on the basis of low income, if they receive certain benefits or their local council considers they are facing financial hardship. Further information on eligibility and how to register can be found at School meals - mygov.scot
Funding for Free School Meals has been provided as follows:
April - June 2020: Â£15 million - remote learning
July - Sept 2020: Â£12.6 million - summer holidays
Oct 2020 - March 2021: Â£6.95 million - Oct, Christmas and Feb holidays
Jan 2021: Â£7.057 million â€“ remote learning
Feb 2021: Â£5.841 million â€“ remote learning
April 2021: Â£4.29 million - Easter holidays
This funding has enabled local authorities to ensure that every eligible child has continued to receive a free school meal alternative â€“ direct payment, voucher or food parcel â€“ throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.

                        New network set up to give platform for young people across Scotlandâ€™s islands.
                    

Children and young people from all 96 of Scotlandâ€™s inhabited islands will be able to have their say and make their voice heard on issues in their communities through the setting up of a new forum.
The new Young Islanders Network will enable children and young people to help shape the delivery of the National Islands Plan, ensuring that their interests and priorities are properly considered.
The network will also give those involved an opportunity to build their confidence, develop key skills such as leadership and organisation and to develop new relationships and friendships with others.
The network will explore issues such as the depopulation of islands and, crucially, will provide an opportunity for our young islanders to raise the issues that matter to them most and make their views known.
Islands Minister Paul Wheelhouse, said:
â€œI am pleased that the Scottish Government is able to now establish this new and exciting network. The Network creates a great opportunity for children and young people on our islands to get involved in having their say and making their views known on key islandsâ€™ issues and to help shape the future of their communities.
â€œOur extensive National Islands Plan consultation made it clear that a Network of this nature would be hugely beneficial, and that it will help to provide us with a better understanding of the experiences and views of children and young people and, through that, ultimately help us to create a better, more diverse living experience for all our islanders of all ages.
â€œThe Network will also be hugely beneficial to those involved, as they will have the chance to be part of an exciting project, gaining valuable insights and developing themselves at the same time. I encourage all children and young people living on our islands to get involved, if they can â€“ and I say to them: if you take the time to make your voice heard, the Government and I will take the time to listen to you.â€
Youth Scotland is setting up the new forum. Youth Scotlandâ€™s Chief Executive Ian McLaughlan, said:
""Youth Scotland believes in better outcomes for all young people - whether that's in our urban cities and towns, rural communities or Scotland's island communities. We are proud of our reach, membership and participation within the island communities. The Young Islander's Challenge is another fantastic opportunity to not only be inclusive of young people living there, but to put them front and centre of a project for and about them.
â€œThanks to our partnership with the Scottish Government and our island communities, we can work together to deliver both short-term and lasting impact. I would urge any young person or group in our island communities to jump in, have your say and be part of something bigger!""
BackgroundÂ  
The Young Islanders Network will meet virtually, in line with current coronavirus restrictions.
Groups involved in the network will be from Shetland; Orkney; Lewis & Harris; Uist and Barra; Skye; Mull; Islay; and Arran.
The project will also include delivery of a 5 week online mental health awareness programme through Mental Health partners Place2Be for those working with young islanders.
The full cost for delivering the Pilot Young Islanders Network will be Â£28,500.

                        13,000 Child Winter Heating Assistance payments made.
                    

Thousands of families of disabled children in Scotland have received an additional Â£200 to help heat their homes this winter.
More than 13,000 families of a disabled child, on the highest rate care component of Disability Living Allowance for Children, have had a Child Winter Heating Assistance payment. These payments were made automatically using information provided by the Department for Work and Pensions.
As of Friday 11 December, a total of Â£2.5 million has been invested in Child Winter Heating Assistance payment.
Where a child has someone managing their benefits, Social Security Scotland has written to them to enable them to process this payment.
Cabinet Secretary for Social Security and Older People Shirley-Anne Somerville said:
â€œI am delighted that we have successfully delivered our first disability benefit, the new Child Winter Heating Assistance.
â€œGetting this money to families as early as possible in the winter months will help them budget and balance the many financial pressures that they face at this time of year. Â For families of the most seriously disabled children and young people, who may need to heat their homes for longer periods, this can bring even more pressure in what is already a challenging circumstance.
â€œWe are committed to making sure that people get everything they are entitled to. I would encourage families who think that they should have received this support and who havenâ€™t had a letter yet to get in touch.â€
Samantha Jones, from Helensburgh, who received the Child Winter Heating Assistance for her two children, Darren and Jacob, said:
â€œI was very happy to see that Social Security Scotland were issuing these payments for children across Scotland.
â€œThis will be a very helpful payment especially at this time of year for families like ours, this will really help and benefit our family and itâ€™s very much appreciated.
â€œHaving the extra money to help with heating costs is one less financial pressure that we have to think about on top of the cost of Christmas.â€
BackgroundÂ 
a client will qualify for Child Winter Heating Assistance if they live in Scotland and were in receipt of the highest rate care component of Disability Living Allowance for children on at least one day between 21 September 2020 to 27 September 2020
if a child has had their Disability Living Allowance highest rate care component award backdated to the Child Winter Heating Assistance qualifying week of 21 September 2020 to 27 September 2020 they need to contact Social Security Scotland to get their Â£200.
if a family believes that they are eligible for this payment and they havenâ€™t had a letter or a payment, they should contact Social Security Scotland from Tuesday 15 December by calling the Freephone helpline on 0800 182 2222 or through web chat at mygov.scot/contact-social-security-scotland/
this is the first form of disability assistance to be introduced by the Scottish Government using its new social security powers.
financial support provided through the Child Winter Heating Assistance is in addition to the Â£100 COVID Winter Hardship Payment which will be made for each child and young person in receipt of Free School Meals on the basis of low income. These payments will be made by local authorities automatically for those eligible.

                        Â£100 million package will help communities at risk.
                    

Funding to help people pay for food, heating, warm clothing and shelter during the winter is part of a new Â£100m support package.
The fund will help those on low incomes, children and people at risk of homelessness or social isolation cope with winter weather and the economic impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) and Brexit.
The Winter Plan for Social Protection, announced by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, will also address domestic abuse and digital exclusion.
COVID-19 has had a significant negative effect on Scotlandâ€™s economy hitting jobs and living standards hard - and Brexit will exacerbate the situation.
With winter approaching, some of Scotlandâ€™s most at-risk communities are facing rising costs for food, fuel and other essentials.
Key elements of the plan include:
Â£22m for low income families including Â£16m to give the low income families of an estimated 156,000 children in receipt of free school meals a one-off Â£100 payment by Christmas
Â£23.5m to help vulnerable children through additional support for residential and care homes, social work, and the Childrenâ€™s Hearing system
Â£15m for the Communities and Third Sector Recovery Programme to support the work of local organisations
Â£5.9m to promote digital inclusion for older people, support social isolation and loneliness and to promote equality
Â£7m to help people who are struggling to pay fuel bills
Â£5m to help those at risk of homelessness find a settled home
The Winter Plan for Social Protection also includes Â£15m of flexible funding for local authorities entering COVID-19 protection level 4 - announced by the First Minister earlier this month â€“ which can be used to pay for food and essentials.
The First Minister said:
â€œWe will shortly become the only part of the UK to give low income families an extra Â£10 per week for every child - initially for children up to age 6 and then for every child up to age 16.
â€œThis has been described as a game changer in the fight to end child poverty. The first payments will be made in February, but I know that for families struggling now, February is still a long way off.
â€œSo I am announcing today a Â£100 million package to bridge that gap, and help others struggling most with the impact of COVID over the winter months.
â€œIt will include money to help people pay their fuel bills and make sure children donâ€™t go hungry. It will offer additional help for the homeless, and fund an initiative to get older people online and connected. And it will provide a cash grant of Â£100 for every child in receipt of Free School Meals as a result of low income.â€Â 
â€œThe money will be paid before Christmas and families can use it for whatever will help them through the winter.
â€œThat could be food, new shoes or a winter coat for the kids. Families will know best what they need - thatâ€™s not for government to decide.
â€œInitiatives like this are not just about providing practical help to those who need it most - they are an expression of our values and of the kind of country we are seeking to build.â€
Background
The Â£100m Winter Plan for Social Protection has been developed to mitigate social harms posed by the concurrent risks of COVID-19, winter cost of living increases and EU exit, as well as to promote equality and human rights.

Contingency plans have been put in place by the Scottish Government to cope with the damaging impacts of Brexit.
Measures to mitigate the worst effects of leaving the European Union (EU) on December 31 will target support at health services, businesses and at risk communities.
With just five weeks to go to the end of the transition period, the UK Government and the EU are still in negotiations over the terms of Brexit with both a no deal and â€˜low dealâ€™ still on the table.
The deal favoured by the UK Government and the prospect of no deal will see Scotland taken out of the Single Market and the Customs Union and mean the end of freedom of movement, negatively impacting jobs and living standards.
Current concerns include the introduction of tariffs, shortages of medical supplies and disruption to imports and exports from new border controls and customs restrictions.
Support measures put in place in Scotland include:
working with UK administrations to ensure patients get the medicines and medical supplies needed
ensuring businesses struggling with cash flow are supported by working with banks through the Banking and Economy Forum
Scottish Enterprise offering targeted advice and guidance to 1200 companies assessed as being particularly vulnerable to Brexit by the end of the year
Refreshed advice, guidance and support to help all Scottish businesses be ready for the end of transition through the Prepare for Brexit website, including EU Exit Helpline, self-help checklist, webinars, articles and newsletters
Â£30 million flexible funding to enable local authorities to tackle financial insecurity over the winter, including extension of free school meals during school holidays
the Scottish Funding Council and Skills Development Scotland working with universities and colleges to ensure they meet the needs of a post-Brexit labour market
the Scottish Governmentâ€™s resilience room (SGORR) will activate in December to coordinate the government response to the most significant issues arising post-exit
Constitution Secretary Michael Russell said:
â€œIt is beyond belief that, in the midst of a global pandemic, Scotland is just five weeks away from being removed from the EU Single Market and Customs Union against its will by the UK Government.
â€œWhatever the outcome of the current negotiations between the UK and the EU we know Scotlandâ€™s economy and its communities are facing unnecessary damage at the worst possible time.
â€œThe Scottish GovernmentÂ  willÂ  continue to do everything we can to mitigate against the consequences of the UK Governmentâ€™s reckless actions to support, as much as we can, our economy, health services and vulnerable communities.
â€œWe will continue that work throughout the transition period and beyond, but the stark truth is that we simply cannot avert every negative outcome and our view is clear that the best future for Scotland is to become an independent country.
â€œOnly by becoming independent can Scotland look forward to once again becoming an equal partner in the EU and take advantage of all the benefits that membership brings.â€
Background
Scottish Government modelling of a basic trade agreement estimates that Scottish GDP would be 6.1% lower by 2030 compared to continued EU membership. This equates to a cost to each person in Scotland of an equivalent to Â£1,600.
A no-deal Brexit scenario has greater economic implications and could see the economy 8.5% smaller by 2030 compared to a scenario of continued EU membership.            ",11/25/2020,Vital support to offset Brexit damage

                        Letter urges UK-wide benefit strategy.
                    

The devolved administrations have united to call on the UK Government to ensure those who are entitled to financial support are receiving it.
Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville has joined Ministers from Wales and Northern Ireland in writing to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey, asking to work together to create a benefit take-up strategy.
The devolved nations have also asked the UK Government to make permanent the current Â£20 a week increase for Universal Credit (UC) and extend it to the benefits which will eventually be replaced by UC, such as Working Tax Credits. The uplift was introduced to help low-income families cope with the extra cost of the COVID-19 outbreak, and is to come to an end in April 2021.
Ms Somerville said: â€œItâ€™s vital that we make every effort to ensure everyone is aware of and able to access the support available to them.
â€œMaximising benefit take-up is a moral obligation, especially in these uncertain times when there is clear evidence of increased need for support.
â€œThe Â£20 uplift was needed before the pandemic, and so it is vital now. People must be given the certainty that it will be made permanent and that they are not facing a cliff edge in a matter of months when this support is pulled.â€
The Welsh Government's Deputy Minister for Housing and Local Government Hannah Blythyn said:
â€œThe pandemic will cast a long shadow on those who are most in need and has reiterated the importance of a robust financial safety net for individuals and families, ensuring existing funding programmes have the maximum impact on the lives of those in poverty.
""Having a strategic UK approach will ensure that everyone can get the support they need during this difficult time.â€
The Scottish Government published its first Benefit Take-up Strategy in October 2019, and will publish the next oneÂ byÂ October 2021.
The Welsh Government has outlined steps it will take to maximise the incomes of families living in poverty in its Child Poverty Income Maximisation Action Plan.
Northern Irelandâ€™s benefit take-up initiative Make the Call has generated over Â£260 million in additional annual benefits for its residents since 2005. It aims to ensure that every individual and household is receiving all the social security benefits and other supports and services to which they are entitled.Â The most recent results for 2019/20 show that this has benefited just under 10,000 people who are now better off by an average of Â£88 per person per week.
The Department for Work and Pensions has no published approach to promoting UK benefits or supporting people to access the money which they are due.
Many people need to be in receipt of a DWP benefit in order to claim other benefits â€“ for example the Scottish Child Payment, where eligibility is reliant on receipt of UC, or Pension Credit which means people can claim a Council Tax reduction, or those over 75 qualify for a free TV licence. So it is vital people are aware of what they are entitled to.
Background
The letter can be read in full (see attached).
As part of their Benefit Take-up Report â€“ published 11 March 2020 â€“ the Scottish Parliamentâ€™s Social Security Committee recommended that the UK Government develops a strategy that aims to maximise take-up of reserved benefits across the UK.
A report by the National Association of Welfare Rights Advisors, published in September 2020, showed a 40% reduction in claims for Personal Independence Payment (PIP) being made during the pandemic. Almost 90% of those surveyed have never seen a take-up advert for PIP.
Independent Age has called for â€˜an ambitious action plan detailing how (the UK government) will work to increase the uptake of Pension Credit over the next five yearsâ€™. More details here. This follows research which concluded that if Pension Credit take-up wasÂ lifted from 61 per cent toÂ 100 per cent, thenÂ almost 450,000Â pensioners could be lifted out of poverty, reducing pensioner poverty to its lowest ever level, and resulting in substantial savings to the NHS and social care systems over the long term.Â Â             ",11/15/2020,Devolved nations call for joint effort to reach those in need

                        Extra money for more than 14,000 disabled children.
                    

Families of disabled children will receive a new heating benefit Â by Christmas.
The Child Winter Heating Assistance is a new Â£200 payment to help families of a child on the highest rate care component of Disability Living Allowance for Children to heat their homes. There are more than 14,000 children expected to be eligible.
Payments will arrive with people from Friday 27 November and these are expected to be complete by Friday 11 December.
People do not need to apply for this payment. It will be made automatically by Social Security Scotland using information provided by the Department for Work and Pensions. Families will get a letter in advance to confirm that they will be getting this payment.
This is the first form of disability assistance to be introduced by the Scottish Government using its new social security powers.
Cabinet Secretary for Social Security and Older People, Shirley Anne Somerville said:
â€œAs the nights draw in and the temperature starts to drop we will all be conscious ofÂ  the extra cost to heat our homes. For families of the most seriously disabled children and young people, who may need to heat their homes for longer periods, this can bring even more pressure in what is already a challenging circumstance.
â€œI am so pleased that we have been able to introduce this payment before Christmas, ensuring people will have this money ahead of the coldest of the winter months. I hope this helps these families plan their finances and that they can turn the heating on without as much worry about how they are going to afford it.
â€œI am delighted that despite the impact of COVID-19, weâ€™ve been able to move forward with three new benefits this year â€“ Job Start Payment, Scottish Child Payment and now Child Winter Heating Assistance. This is the first disability assistance that we will deliver using our new social security powers..
â€œWe are continuing to work with delivery partners to review the timeline for introduction of our remaining benefits and we will do everything we can to start these as soon as we can practically and safely do so.â€
Background
a client will qualify for Child Winter Heating Assistance if they live in Scotland and were in receipt of the highest rate care component of Disability Living Allowance for children on at least one day between 21 September 2020 to 27 September 2020. 
families will get letters in advance to confirm to expect this payment. Payments will be made in batches from Monday 23 November and arrive in peopleâ€™s banks approximately four days later. It is expected to take two weeks to complete all payments. This payment will be made to the same account that they receive Disability Assistance Living Allowance for Children payments to. 
families will get a payment for every child who receives the highest rate Disability Living Allowance for children. This is not a per household payment.
if a family believes that they are eligible for this payment and they havenâ€™t had a letter or a payment, they should contact Social Security Scotland from Tuesday 8 December for further advice.
people can contact Social Security Scotland through web chat at mygov.scot/contact-social-security-scotland/ by calling the Freephone helpline on 0800 182 2222.
while the pandemic continues to have an impact on our operations and our delivery partners - including health and social care and the Department for Work and Pensions - we are doing what we can to progress policy, design and development work. We are still working through what the impacts of COVID-19 mean for our delivery timeline and holding conversations with partners to establish what we can introduce and when.

                        Change to implementation due to coronavirus impact.
                    

The Scottish Government will ask parliament to delay new regulations on smoke and carbon monoxide alarms by 12 months due to the impact of coronavirus (COVID-19)
Legislation due to come into effect in February 2021 meant the standard which currently applies to private rented property and new-builds would have been extended to all homes in Scotland.
Due to the practical difficulties likely to be faced by homeowners seeking to make the necessary changes to their homes, the Scottish Government will now seek to move implementation back to February 2022.
Kevin Stewart, Minister for Local Government and Housing, said:
â€œFire safety is an absolute priority for the Scottish Government, and we remain committed to implementing these improved regulations, which will mean everyone will benefit from the same level of protection, whether they own their home or rent from a social or private landlord.
â€œGiven the impact of COVID-19, and the difficulties this is likely to create for people seeking to install new smoke and carbon monoxide alarms, we have listened to concerns and decided to ask the Scottish Parliament to delay implementation.
â€œIf this delay is approved, we will continue to work with partners to spread awareness of the changes before the new deadline. Our focus will be on supporting householders to ensure satisfactory fire alarms are installed so we can improve the safety of their homes.â€
Background:
The legal duty on complying with the legislation will rest with local authorities and not with individual householders.
The improved standards will mean every home in Scotland must have a smoke alarm fitted in the living room or lounge, and in circulation spaces such as hallways and landings. The changes also mean every kitchen must have a heat alarm, and the alarms will have to be interlinked so they can be heard throughout the property. There must also be a carbon monoxide alarm where there are fixed combustion appliances.Â 
Homeowners can install tamper proof long-life lithium battery alarms themselves. Mains-wired alarms are also available and are generally cheaper than the tamper proof long-life battery alarms but should be installed by a qualified electrician. Both types of alarm are widely available in general hardware outlets and online.
The Scottish Government has made more than Â£15 million of loan funding available for Social Landlords ensuring that social tenants are safe in their homes, and provided funding of Â£870,000 each year for two years to the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service to support their Home Safety Visits to ensure vulnerable and high risk people can get the necessary alarms installed at no cost to them so that they areÂ safe in their homes.

The proportion of schools reported as being in good or satisfactory condition has increased to 89.9% (88.3% in 2019). This is 29 percentage points higher than in April 2007 (61.1%).
Meanwhile, the proportion of pupils present on Healthy Living Survey day in February 2020 who took a school meal, free or paid for, decreased to 53.3.% from 54.5% in 2019.
Scotland's Chief Statistician today published two releases on schools in Scotland.
School Estates Statistics 2020 also showed that the proportion of pupils educated in schools in â€œpoorâ€ or â€œbadâ€ condition has decreased from 36.6% of all pupils (around 257,000) in 2007 to 8.9% of all pupils (around 62,000) in 2020.
Since 2007-08, 958 schools have been built or substantially refurbished (includes those with cost of at least Â£500,000 for primary schools and at least Â£1 million for secondary and special schools).
School Healthy Living Survey Statistics 2020 also showed that the proportion of pupils who were registered for free school meals, present on survey day and took a free meal decreased from 78.1% in 2019 to 76.2% in 2020.
The proportion of all schools meeting the Physical Education (PE) target of at least two hours in primary and two periods (100 minutes) at secondary school in 2020 remained the same as in 2019 at 99%. Almost 100% of primary schools are meeting the target, the same as 2019, and the proportion of secondary schools meeting the target in 2020 also remained the same as in 2019 at 94%.

                        Non-repayable bursaries and grants rise 13.4%.
                    

Scottish Government funding for students in higher education rose to more than Â£1 billion in the last academic year (2019-20), according to figures from the Student Awards Agency Scotland (SAAS).
Within that total, awards of non-repayable bursaries and grants for full-time students rose 13.4 per cent.
The latest numbers show 148,570 full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students, 20,030 part-time students and 9,580 nursing and midwifery students (a total of 178,180) were supported through SAAS in the form of a bursary, grant, fees or loan. The total support provided increased by 2.8% from Â£981.6 million in 2018-19 to Â£1.009 billion in 2019-20.
Average support per full-time student was Â£6,140 â€“ an increase from Â£6,010 in the previous session â€“ with the overall amount provided in non-repayable bursaries and grants increasing from Â£80.2 million in 2018-2019 to Â£90.9 million last year.
Higher Education Minister Richard Lochhead said: 
â€œFor the total university student support number to top Â£1 billion for the first time is a really significant milestone - news which is all the more welcome, given the uncertain times in which we are living because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
â€œTo see that 13.4% rise in what is non-repayable money being given to students should prove a welcome boost to many. In recent months, of course, the Scottish Government has also been reacting to the financial challenges facing the sector because of COVID-19, including committing to fully funding additional places required as a result of SQA results being regraded.
â€œIn July, we announced our Further and Higher Education Sustainability Plan, which highlights many steps we have taken to support higher education, including the development of an International Student Action Plan, hardship support of Â£5 million across FE and HE student support and early access to Â£11.4 million of HE Discretionary Funds.â€

The total amount provided in non-repayable bursaries and grants for full-time students increased by 13.4 per cent, from Â£80.2 million in 2018-2019 to Â£90.9 million in 2019-2020 â€“ awarded to 54,190 students (down from 54,480 in 2018-2019)
The total amount authorised in living cost loans was Â£540.1 million, a 6.3% increase from Â£533.8 million in 2018-2019, at an average of Â£5,320 per student
There were 15,235 European Union (EU) students supported in 2019-2020 (10.3 per cent of all students supported) who received Â£32.1 million of funding - 3.5 per cent of the total amount of support given to all students
A further 20,030 students were provided fee support whilst studying on a part-time basis in 2019-2020. The total amount of support was Â£16.8 million at an average of Â£840 per student. This is a decrease of around 700 students (from 20,740) and from an average of Â£830 per student, compared to 2018-2019.
SAAS also administer support for students undertaking courses in pre-registration nursing and midwifery leading to the award of a degree. In 2019-2020 there were 9,580 students receiving support through the Nursing and Midwifery Bursary (NMSB) scheme â€“ compared to 9,180 in 2018-2019. These students received Â£79.5 million in support at an average of Â£8,300 per student.

                        UK government urged to strengthen social security system.
                    

Housing Minister Kevin Stewart has written to the UK Government calling for urgent action to support housing tenants affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
In a letter to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Mr Stewart identifies five key areas in which the benefits system and support for people who rent their home should be urgently strengthened.
The Housing Minister urges the UK government to:
â€¢ lift Local Housing Allowance rates further to make more homes affordable to renters â€¢ suspend the removal of the spare room subsidyâ€¢ suspend the benefit capâ€¢ suspend the shared accommodation rate for under-35sâ€¢ extend the backdating of benefits for those who might not have realised they were eligible and relax the criteria under which backdating is allowable
The Scottish Government took action in the first emergency COVID-19 legislation to protect tenants from eviction for at least six months. Recently it made an additional Â£5 million available in discretionary housing payments to support those renting, increasing this fund to Â£16 million â€“ this is further to that made available to fully mitigate the bedroom tax.
FULL TEXT OF LETTER
The Rt Hon Dr ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Caxton House Tothill Street London SW1H 9AJ
Dear Ms Coffey
I am writing to urge further consideration of the need to strengthen the social security system for renters affected by COVID-19.
In this unprecedented crisis, the Scottish Government and local authorities swiftly took a range of steps to protect renters from eviction through extended notice periods and extension of mandatory grounds. We have also moved to provide additional financial support within our devolved powers and budgets.
In order to support tenants during the crisis, we have increased the amount available for other discretionary housing payments (DHPs) by Â£5 million to almost Â£16 million. This takes our overall investment in DHPs in 2020/21 to more than Â£76 million. We took these steps to support those for whom the UK welfare state is not providing the safety net it should.
We are also supporting private landlords by offering loans and encouraging them to take mortgage breaks where available, although we know this is limited for some. We continue to engage with landlords across the rented sector to ensure that they are coming to agreements with tenants on rent arrears and signposting tenants to the range of financial support available.
The Scottish Government remains committed to working collaboratively with the UK Government to ensure that the social and economic effects of COVID-19 are mitigated effectively and efficiently so that people do not face hardship or homelessness. We have set out the steps we would like you to take in various pieces of correspondence during the pandemic.
The benefits system is an essential lifeline for many people facing or experiencing homelessness throughout the UK. Housing elements of social security remain a crucial part of the support required by tenants facing financial difficulty or homelessness as a result of the pandemic and remain reserved to you. The changes you have made to local housing allowance (LHA) rates are welcome, but fall short of what is needed to provide comprehensive support to people living in rented accommodation.
In addition to our previous calls to lift the benefit cap; to scrap or relax the restrictions around the removal of the spare room subsidy; to provide more information to local authorities to help signpost available support to tenants; and to support quicker payments for discretionary housing payments, I urge you to consider further action to support people who rent their homes. This is an area where urgent intervention is required in light of emerging evidence of the inequity of support available between those who rent and those who hold a mortgage.
Recent research by the Resolution Foundation demonstrates this in stark terms, finding that mortgage holders entered the crisis with lower average housing costs relative to income and a bigger financial buffer than renters, a disparity reflected in the fact that renters were far more likely to be facing difficulty in meeting their housing costs than those with a mortgage. This same research also found that the level of mortgage holders seeking and successfully securing a mortgage holiday is far higher (12%) than the number of private renters seeking and successfully securing rent reductions from their landlords (5%).
We know that many people will find themselves in financial difficulty for the first time from job loss or substantial income reductions. Given the scale at which this is occurring for households across the country, it is vital that the safety net of social security is accessible and sufficient to support people through this national crisis and a new approach to the housing element of social security is now needed.
â€¢ We know that low-income families will have no savings to cushion them from the financial impact of the pandemic. We urge you to suspend the removal of the spare room subsidy, particularly as a spare room becomes essential when larger families need space to isolate.
â€¢ To support those with high rents who are currently unable to source lower cost accommodation, we would ask you to suspend the benefit cap. This will help to reduce the risk of immediate and short term hardship for families who are unable to meet housing costs, and will help to ensure that the support you have made available through investment in LHA rates and the increase in the standard allowance rate of universal credit is not undermined.
â€¢ We have seen the benefit of restored LHA rates in Edinburgh, with several hundred properties now affordable to renters, but the majority of renters will still struggle to source affordable accommodation and people must be able to maintain tenancies beyond the immediate crisis. We urge you to lift LHA rates further, bearing in mind that the 30th percentile still represents a cut when compared to the 50th percentile that applied before UK Government welfare changes.
â€¢ The high number of individuals under the age of 35 who have moved in with their parents during this crisis highlights the need for better housing support for young people. Like many stakeholders in the Scottish housing sector, we believe there is a strong case for suspending the shared accommodation rate for under 35s, especially as many who have lost jobs during the crisis are likely to be younger people.
â€¢ Finally, we ask you to extend the backdating of benefits for those who might not have realised they were eligible and relax the criteria under which backdating is allowable.
The Resolution Foundation figures are concerning and the risk to households who rent their homes is immediate and pressing. We must work collectively to act now to support a group of people facing mounting rent arrears and financial difficulty they would not have if they were mortgage holders. You will be aware of similar calls from leading homelessness organisations who are hearing concerns from their clients.
I am happy to discuss any of the points raised in this letter and wish to further reaffirm the offers from Scottish ministers to work with you on any other actions you are considering in response to COVID-19. I hope that by working together our governments can provide the most effective form of support during this crisis and afterwards.
Kind regards

                        Earlier financial help for those facing hardship.
                    

Students facing hardship this summer due to COVID-19 can now receive financial support within a package of new measures.
The Scottish Government has brought forward early access to Â£11.4 million of discretionary funds - support for higher education students in financial difficulty â€“ to be administered by colleges and universities.
Unlike continuing higher education students, most former further education students can receive benefits if they are unemployed. Colleges will now have flexibility to offer discretionary funds to bridge the timing gap between bursary payments ending in June and Universal Credit payments starting.
Scottish students studying in Europe as part of EU Portability or historically arranged schemes will be able to access a Â£100,000 emergency fund administered by the Student Awards Agency Scotland (SAAS).
SAAS has also suspended all new debt recovery actions in respect to grants and bursaries until September for students whose circumstances have changed and may have to return overpayments.Â Students are encouraged to contact SAAS to discuss what help is available.
Minister for Further, Higher Education and Science Richard Lochhead said:
â€œGiven the economic impact of COVID-19, many continuing students who rely on seasonal and part-time jobs in the summer could find it difficult to cover their basic housing or cost of living costs.
â€œNo student should face financial hardship as a result - so these new measures will support students until the start of the next academic year when bursary, grant and loan payments will begin again.Â 
Â â€œWe are now bringing forward Â£11.4 million in support for higher education students in financial difficulty that was not due to be available until the new academic year. This builds on our Â£5 million support plan for FE and HE students announced in April.
â€œThe UK Government package announced on 4 May for higher education providers and students was disappointing, and fell short of recognising the full scale of the challenge.â€
Background
In early April, the Scottish Government announced an emergency package of support for students facing hardship, applying dedicated COVID-19 Discretionary Funds.Â  An additional Â£2.2 million was provided for HE students at college and university, on top of a supplementary redistributed Â£569,000 Discretionary Fund.Â  The Scottish Funding Council also brought forward Â£2 million to support FE students at college.Â  Additional measures provided early access to the HE Care-experienced Accommodation Grant, support for HE students studying at Private Providers, and a suspension of any new debt recovery by the Student Awards Agency Scotland (SAAS).

                        Immediate wage increase and sick pay provision.
                    

Social care staff are to receive an immediate 3.3% pay increase backdated from 1 April.
The move, agreed between the Scottish Government and COSLA, means staff will not need to wait for the pay to be backdated at a point later in the year following negotiations, as has happened in previous years.
It is part of a package of measures to support social care workers in recognition of the vital role they are playing during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
Social care support workers providing direct adult support will have their pay increased to at least the Real Living Wage rate of Â£9.30 an hour for all hours worked, including sleep-overs and hours worked by personal assistants.
The Scottish Government will also provide funding to third sector and independent providers specifically to ensure staff receive sick pay if they are off work ill or because they are self-isolating.Â 
In addition, the agreed funding increase to these providers will give them the financial flexibility to increase wages across their organisations, and not just to frontline staff.
Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said:
â€œScotlandâ€™s dedicated social care workers are on the frontline of our national pandemic response. Their work is always hugely valued, and never more so than now.
â€œThe measures we are announcing in partnership with COSLA today will ensure all people providing adult social care receive the Real Living Wage for every hour worked with immediate effect, rather than having to wait until later in the year.
â€œAs well as providing an uplift in pay for all social care workers, this package ensures social care providers have both flexibility to increase wages across their organisations and the necessary funding for sick pay if their employees are off ill or are self-isolating.â€
Cllr Stuart Currie, COSLA spokesperson for Health and Social Care, said:
â€œLocal Government recognise and value the vital contribution of Scotlandâ€™s social care workforce and have made great efforts together to achieve an agreement that confirms the living wage as well as supporting providers where they are experiencing additional cost associated with COVID-19. Todayâ€™s announcement reflects the key worker status of social care support staff and confirms support for those off sick or self-isolating.â€
Andy Kerr, Chair of the Fair Work in Social Care Group, said:
â€œThis announcement will provide social care providers the confidence, in these very challenging times, to ensure a very welcome and deserved pay uplift for social care staff working in Scotland. As well as recognising the importance of their work, todayâ€™s announcement also gives reassurance that financial support is available for those who are sick or self-isolating during this unprecedented situation. It also reflects the work we are doing as part of the overall reform of adult social care to build a framework for fair work across the sector.â€
Background
A joint letter from Ms Freeman and Cllr Currie was issued to all local authorities setting out details of the package. This follows their previous letter to local authorities and integrated joint boards to confirm the key worker status of social care workers, and their access to childcare and support where required.Â 
Since October 2016, the Scottish Government has provided funding to enable adult social care workers to be paid the Real Living Wage for waking hours. During 2018/19, this commitment was extended to include those undertaking overnight social care support. The commitment covers adult social care workers providing direct care and support to adults in care homes, care at home, day care and housing support.

                        Justice Secretary announces Â£100,000 â€˜victims fundâ€™ to help those in need.
                    

Victims of crime struggling financially amid the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic will be able to access assistance worth up to Â£3,000, Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf has announced.
A victimsâ€™ fund of Â£100,000 will help meet immediate financial needs of victims, paying for a wide range of goods and services where they have no other access to funds.
Victim Support Scotland (VSS), which will administer the fund, already provides financial support totalling Â£30,000 a year through the Scottish Government-backed â€˜victimsâ€™ fundâ€™. The new enhanced fund increases this to Â£100,000 and is available to victims supported by other organisations as well as VSS.
Following discussions with a range of victims organisations about the immediate and potential impact of the current national crisis and public health response â€“ particularly on some of Scotlandâ€™s most vulnerable victims of crime â€“ the Scottish Government has increased the size of the fund for the new financial year by Â£70,000.
Mr Yousaf said:
â€œAcross the country, we are seeing incredible acts of courage and self-sacrifice as we all strive to keep our loved-ones and our communities safe in this public health emergency.
â€œHowever, for victims of crime, the impact of their own experience can be long-lasting â€“ even before we consider the understandable anxiety that they will be feeling, along with most of us, about the coronavirus outbreak.
â€œWhile overall crime, including non-sexual violent crime, has fallen substantially over the last decade, we know that those living in our most disadvantaged communities are more likely to experience crime.
â€œThat is why Iâ€™ve decided to increase our investment in the victims fund and help deliver a range of goods and services which are likely to be required by the most vulnerable victims during the outbreak. This includes support such as food vouchers, help with utility bills, as well as assistance for domestic abuse victims who may have to urgently leave their homes.
â€œThe fund will also be able to help with other costs which have arisen as a direct result of being a victim of crime such as contributions towards insurance excesses, improved home security, and replacement windows, doors and furniture.â€
Kate Wallace, Chief Executive of Victim Support Scotland, said:
â€œThe increase to the victimsâ€™ fund is hugely beneficial at this time when people are social distancing, self-isolating and spending more time online. Isolation, in particular, can impact people affected by crime as their support networks may not beÂ available in the same ways as before.Â We expect certain crime types to rise, such as fraud, cybercrime, stalking and domestic, child and elderly abuse.Â The fund will allow us to be adaptive and responsive to individual victimâ€™s needs.
â€œThese are challenging times which have the potential to greatly affect victims. Victim Support Scotland is committed to providing practical help and emotional support to anyone affected by crime during the coronavirus outbreak and has increased helpline and webchat services. We encourage anyone who needs support to get in touch.â€
Background:
Victim Support Scotland provide free emotional and practical support for victims and witnesses of crime. Their Freephone helpline number is 0800 160 1985 and their website is http://www.victimsupport.scot.
Victim Support Scotlandâ€™s current victims fund is available now. The enhanced fund will be available from 1 April 2020. It is administered by Victim Support Scotland and used to cover the costs of goods and services for people affected by crime across Scotland.
Victim Support Scotland are working closely with other victim support organisations, such as Rape Crisis Scotland and Scottish Womenâ€™s Aid, to ensure financial support through the victims fund is available for a wide range of victims.
The Scottish Government introduced a new Victim Surcharge in November 2019, which will go towards a fund to pay for short-term and practical help to those harmed by crime â€“ such as replacing broken windows and locks for victims of house-breaking, or help towards funeral expenses for families bereaved by crime. The Victimsâ€™ Surcharge Fund (VSF) - which requires offenders to contribute to the cost of supporting victims of crime - will, in time, accumulate growing funds in order to meet the type of costs that the VSS victimsâ€™ fund currently meet. The VSF is expected to open to applications in late 2020.            ",3/29/2020,Extra support for crime victims during pandemic

                        Motability Scheme accredited to provide wide choice of vehicles at affordable rates.
                    

Disabled people will continue to be able to lease mobility vehicles under Scotlandâ€™s new social security system.
The Scottish Government has accredited the charity Motability Scheme to provide cars, wheelchair accessible vehicles, scooters and powered wheelchairs that can be adapted to meet disabled peopleâ€™s needs.
The service provides access to a wide choice of vehicles at affordable rates without the need for credit checks for people who receive a disability benefit at the appropriate rate, meaning users only have to cover fuel costs.
Announcing the accreditation award at Macklin Motors in Dunfermline, Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said:
â€œAccess to an appropriate vehicle that can be adapted to meet the needs of disabled people provides a vital lifeline and freedom to get around that might not be possible otherwise.
â€œWe want to make sure those who need that support have access to a competitive range of affordable vehicles that meet their needs and a package that keeps them on the road without problem.
â€œThe Motability Scheme is a charity that has already been providing a high level of service in Scotland for 43 years. It has been accredited for Scotlandâ€™s new social security system after an open and fair competitive tendering process.
â€œDisabled adults and children already using the scheme and those that will benefit in the future can be confident that level of service will continue.â€
Barry Le Grys, Chief Executive of Motability, said:Â Â 
â€œThe Motability Scheme is delighted to continue to work closely with the Scottish Government to support the needs of disabled people and their families.
â€œAs a scheme that is passionate about delivering affordable, worry free motoring, we are proud to support more than 620,000 customers across the UK, attracting a 92% renewal rate, satisfaction rating of 9.8 out of 10, and 97% of customers happy to recommend the scheme to others.
â€œFollowing this welcome announcement, we are pleased to be continuing to offer these services to our many Scottish customers, both today and tomorrow, and our investment in Scotland continues with a new office taking shape near Edinburgh, and formally opening later this spring.â€
Etienne dâ€™Aboville, Chief Executive of the Glasgow Centre for Inclusive Living, said:
â€œEncountering barriers to mobility is an all too common experience for many disabled and older people. Yet being able to travel freely and independently, where possible, is crucial if we are to enjoy equal citizenship and participate fully in our communities.
â€œAs a full-time wheelchair user and long-time wheelchair accessible vehicle driver, I can testify what a difference this has made to my own independence and quality of life.
â€œI therefore welcome the Scottish Governmentâ€™s launch of Scotlandâ€™s own Accessible Vehicles and Equipment Scheme. This is a golden opportunity for Scotland to take the best of the broadly successful Motability Scheme and improve it further still.â€
Background
The Scottish Government will introduce the Child Disability Benefit this summer and the Disability Assistance for Working Age People early next year. Both benefits have a mobility element that can be used for the Motability Scheme.
Lease payments for vehicles will be deducted directly from the higher rate mobility allowance provided in the new disability benefit payments. As with the current system, insurance, maintenance and breakdown cover are included in the package, with fuel the only cost users have to pay for.
Motability is a Registered Charity in England and Wales (number 299745) and is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (Reference number 736309).

                        4G programme delivers first mast.
                    

Residents in New Luce, Wigtownshire, are the first in Scotland to benefit from a programme to provide 4G to areas with no mobile coverage from any operator.
The mast is one of up to 24 scheduled to be rolled out over the next two years, with further mast sites under consideration.
Vodafone is now providing 4G, 3G and 2G services from the new mast. EE is expected to do so later this year, and will provide service from a majority of sites in the programme.
The Scottish 4G Infill (S4GI) Programme is backed by Â£15 million of Scottish Government funding and Â£10 million from the European Regional Development Fund. It was set up in 2018 to address Scotlandâ€™s mobile â€˜notspotsâ€™ â€“ areas with no mobile coverage â€“ and is being delivered by WHP Telecoms, managed by the Scottish Futures Trust.Â 
Connectivity Minister Paul Wheelhouse said:
â€œWhile telecommunications is a responsibility of UK ministers, improving mobile coverage is vital to achieving the Scottish Governmentâ€™s ambition to make sure everyone in Scotland has access to high-speed, reliable coverage.
â€œPeople in New Luce are the first to benefit but we hope that, like Wigtownshire, many more remote and rural parts of Scotland and Scotlandâ€™s islands will soon enjoy improved, cost-effective connectivity as a result of the Scottish Governmentâ€™s work with industry and other partners, and our investment in the Â£25 million S4GI Programme.â€
WHP Telecoms Strategic Development director Martyn Cheyne said:
â€œThis is a great achievement for all involved and another important moment in WHP Telecomsâ€™ growth. Providing connectivity to mobile â€˜notspotsâ€™ is transformational but challenging, it takes a truly collaborative approach to succeed. Thank you to the fantastic S4GI teams at WHP, Scottish Government and Scottish Futures Trust, to Vodafone, Cornerstone, Openreach, Scottish Power, the landowner and tenant farmer, and to the New Luce Community Trust who have all supported WHP in making this possible.â€
Background:
Vodafone UK Chief Executive Officer Nick Jeffery said:
â€œMore than a quarter of the UK population live in rural areas. We are investing heavily to extend the reach of our network to these communities such as those living in New Luce. No one should feel cut off from online services whether educational or recreational. This is why we pioneered network sharing and are keen to support this programme, as well as similar ones, in order to provide fast mobile services in remote locations while minimising the environmental impact.â€
BT consumer division Chief Executive Officer Marc Allera said:
â€œWeâ€™re pleased to be playing a leading part in this exciting initiative by the Scottish Government to help expand mobile coverage in rural Scotland. EE already has the largest 4G network in Scotland and this programme will allow our superfast 4G network to reach even more of the country. 4G is helping to transform Scottish communities, allowing consumers, businesses and the emergency services to connect in new ways.â€

                        Minister calls for urgent reform.
                    

In a letter to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart has criticised â€œtweaksâ€ to Local Housing Allowance rates, saying they will do nothing to tackle the past damage caused by years of austerity or the future damage still to be inflicted by UK Government welfare cuts.
Mr Stewart said: â€œThe potential impacts on household finances, rental arrears and ultimately homelessness as a result of the LHA not being brought up to an acceptable level are very concerning. These tweaks will leave people who need support through the UK welfare system exposed to an unfair system, with some people unable to afford suitable affordable accommodation.
â€œAn average increase of less than 1.7% equates to less than five pounds a week, or as little as 40p for some people and is hardly the end of austerity that was promised.
â€œThe Scottish Government continues to do what it can in the face of the worst of impacts of UK cuts, with more than Â£60 million a year being spent in Discretionary Housing Payments to mitigate the UK Governmentâ€™s Bedroom Tax and low levels of Local Housing Allowance rates. What is needed is a multi-year plan for investment at UK Government level to limit the damage caused by of years of austerity and a decent increase in the LHA.â€
Background
Housing benefit for private tenants is called Local Housing Allowance (LHA) which can help towards the cost of rent, but it doesn't cover charges for heating, hot water, lighting, laundry or cooking.
The rate of LHA people receive depends on the area theyâ€™re living in, and the number of rooms they need. This makes sure people living in the same area as you under the same circumstances get the same amount of support.

                        Extra help to pay for funerals. Â 
                    

Extra support will be made available for people on low income benefits to pay for the cost of a funeral.
The Funeral Support Paymentâ€™s rate for expenses such as funeral director fees, a coffin, and flowers, is to be increased from Â£700 to Â£1,000 for all applications received from 1 April.
The Funeral Support Payment is made up of three separate parts: burial or cremation costs; travel costs; and a standard rate for other expenses â€“ and it is this element which is being increased.
Introduced in September last year, the Funeral Support Payment replaced the UK Governmentâ€™s Funeral Expense Payment in Scotland, greatly increasing eligibility. It is intended to help alleviate the burden of debt faced by those on low income benefits when paying for a funeral.
Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said:
â€œAt a time when families are struggling to come to terms with the death of a loved one, the last thing they need is extra financial stress.
â€œI am proud we are increasing the standard rate by 40% to Â£1,000 to support those paying for a funeral just months after introducing this important new payment.
â€œThis increase, alongside the extended eligibility we have introduced, means the Funeral Support Payment is there to ease the pressures on up to 5,000 people annually at such a difficult time in their lives. So far the total average pay-out has been around Â£1,500.
â€œThis benefit is part of the new Social Security system we are building from scratch for the Scottish people, with fairness, dignity and respect at its heart.â€
Background
The flat rate payment for other expenses may be used towards any other funeral expenses such as funeral director fees, a coffin, and flowers.
Those eligible for the Funeral Support Payment must be living in Scotland, have had the nearest relationship to the person who has died, be financially responsible for the funeral and be on a qualifying benefit or tax credit (e.g. Income Support, Jobseekers Allowance, Universal Credit, Employment and Support Allowance, Pension Credit, Housing Benefit, Child Tax Credit, Disability or severe disability element of Working Tax Credit).
Around 5,000 people are expected to be supported annually by the payment.
